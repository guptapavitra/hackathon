The actress, who started her filmy career as a child artist in Tamil cinema, went on to become the top actress in Bollywood, After her demise, many stories about her personal life is doing the rounds on the net that she was previously, secretly married to actor Mithun Chakraborty in 1985, a man already married to Yogeeta Bali.     Later, when Yogeeta got to know about Sridevi-Mithun's marriage, she allegedly attempted suicide. However, Yogeeta told a leading daily, "I will accept it even if he has a second wife."  Reports say that at this point, Sridevi got to know that Mithun was not divorced like he claimed and was in fact still married to Yogeeta. Soon, Sridevi allegedly got her marriage to Mithun annulled and broke up in 1988 ever since she got to know the disco dancer would never hurt or leave Yogeeta.     Mithun went back to Yogeeta, and things seemed to be back to normal when the wife gave birth to their third son, Namashi. There was another report that said Mona Kapoor, Boney Kapoor's first wife, had revealed in an interview with the Savvy magazine that Sridevi had tied a rakhi on Boney's wrist to show her love to Mithun and that there was nothing going on between Boney and her.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/u4uvoice-epaper-uvoice/7th+pay+commission+cpc+benefits+for+j+k+employees+explained-newsid-80007934| Jammu And Kashmir  7th Pay Commission: CPC Benefits For J&K Employees EXPLAINED | New Delhi, Jan 15: The government employees of Jammu and Kashmir state will receive benefits under the 7th Pay Commission or 7th CPC from April 1, announced the state Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu on Friday. The 7th Pay Commission recommendations will also be implemented retrospectively from January 2016 in Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, Finance Ministry has reportedly ruled out the possibility of a hike in minimum pay for the top and middle-level employees of central government beyond the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation. "I am committed to implementing 7th Pay Commission recommendations from April 1, 2018," Haseeb Drabu told the Assembly while presenting his fourth budget. He also announced the release of 1 per cent Dearness Allowance for government employees retrospectively from July 1 last year. The state government employees termed the announcement over the implementation of 7th Pay Commission's recommendations as 'a victory without war'.  "In general, it is the employee-friendly budget and we are thankful to the government for announcing the 7th Pay Commission. For us, it is a victory without war," Abdul Qayoom Wani, president of the Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC), told a Kashmir-based newspaper. Wani added that the employees were readying themselves to hit the streets if the government wouldn't have announced the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission. As far as a hike in minimum pay and fitment factor beyond the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for the central government employees is concerned, there is no clarity. There would be no hike in minimum pay beyond the recommendation of the 7th Pay Commission for the top and middle-level employees of the central government, a Sen Times report said quoting a top Finance Ministry official. "They will never be given hike in pay matrix above the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation because they do not need it," the official said. "The government have already reviewed the salaries and perks of the central government above the pay matrix level 5 and decided they do not need higher pay matrix levels," he added. The central government employees have been asking to raise minimum pay to Rs 26,000 and fitment factor 3.68 times from 2.57 times. The government had approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission on a hike in salary of central government employees in June 2016. The 7th Pay Commission had recommended a 14.27 percent hike in basic pay, raising minimum pay from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 month. Under the 7th Pay Commission, the basic salary of the lowest rank employee will be around Rs 18,000 and pay for the highest office of Chief second will be around Rs 2.25 lakh.     < Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 16 Jan, 11.28 am

PM Modi, in Britain for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, was also expected to confirm the new India-UK Trade Partnership, which London said "will seek to improve the accessibility of trade for businesses in both countries" as Britain leaves the European Union next year.   The government said the investments would create or safeguard 5,750 British jobs.  Prime Minister Theresa May, who is hoping to secure a free trade agreement with India after Brexit said, "Our trade partnership is showing how we can remove barriers to increase trade between our two countries." Total trade in goods and services between Britain and India was 18 billion pounds in 2017. But PM Modi's visit was not without controversy, as several hundred protesters greeted him noisily outside parliament. The demonstrators were mostly Muslims and Sikhs calling for an end to "religious persecution". Protesters chanted "Modi go back" and "Modi is a terrorist". Kashmiri separatists held aloft flags, while others displayed posters depicting an eight-year-old Muslim girl, who was raped and murdered in Kathua in January, allegedly by a group that included policemen and a former government official. Other demonstrators included Sikhs demanding independence. "Lots of different groups are here," said Dupinder Jit, a Sikh businessman. "What is happening in Modi's regime is unacceptable, he is killing minorities." Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 11.48 am3 months ago2 days ago2 days ago10 hrs ago3 months ago

Anyone who knew the veteran actress would tell you that she was extremely fit and her sudden demise came as a shock to many. Now, the point to be noted is that she suffered a cardiac arrest and not a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a section of the heart. If not re-opened quickly, that part of the heart starts dying. Cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat. The heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs and the person loses consciousness.  Sridevi was rumoured to have gone under the knife several times. Botox treatments, lip-jobs, etc. she's done them all. While it is a personal choice, it seems these operations could've added to a higher stress level in her body, which culminated in a weak heart and eventually a cardiac arrest.

Here is why men #HateCondoms | Durex India, which claims to be the best condom brand in India, has tweeted that 95 percent of men in India do not use condoms. This has led to a campaign #HateCondoms and believe me; this is the topmost trending hashtag on Twitter. It is said that the percentage is based on the findings of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). What’s happening India? 95% of Indians don’t use condoms! We’d love to know why?— Durex India (@DurexIndia) March 5, 2018  But do people really hate condoms? Or was the company speaking about people not using the Durex condoms? The Twitterati expressed mixed reactions to this finding. While many found it difficult to believe the numbers, others gave reasons, why men do not like wearing condoms.  However, according to Business Standard report based on the findings of the NFHS in 2017, the use of contraceptive pills and condoms has risen in India even as there has been a decline in adopting overall family planning methods. The statistics by NFHS stated that between the previous survey, 10 years ago, and now, the use of pills has risen to 4.1 percent from 3.1 percent, and that of condoms to 5.6 percent from 5.2 percent. So, what has happened to Indian men in 2018? On the other hand, use of contraceptives by women has gone up to 54%. This might provide some answers to why the number of men using condoms has come down. Men don't like compromising on the sexual pleasures but can order their women to use contraceptives? Is this what's happening? Maybe there is need for a new hashtag #HateCondomsButLoveContraceptives?  Hey does Condoms take the amazing feeling of sex away? I don't think so. Then why so #HateCondoms ?— Oye_Sonali (@Oye_Sonali) March 5, 2018    Mainly because of this fact, you may now think of condoms to be as essential as guns while in combat. #HateCondoms— Pooja (@bindas_pari) March 5, 2018    I #HateCondoms because 40 rs diye condom ke or fatt bhi gaya BC 72 hours wali tablet ke 80 rs or lag gaye🙄😑— डाँ लाडले बाबा (@SonOfChoudhary) March 5, 2018    LOL 95% of Indians don't wear condoms coz it's like chewing on an Eclairs with the wrapper on. But seriously, why do people #hatecondoms? https://t.co/R9OXs08UWT— Gabbbar (@GabbbarSingh) March 5, 2018    I don't believe that 95% of Indians don't use or #HateCondoms I mean look at the Valentine's day shopping @DurexIndia pic.twitter.com/ugTZjP1P0T— Hussain (@ImHussaina) March 5, 2018   So much so even Priyanka Gandhi fan page too Tweeted on #HateCondoms   Well-wisher cronies of BJP including Chhota Modi, Mehul Bhai and Jatin Mehta left us for paying higher EMIs and increased rates of interest.

Bollywood is what means entertainment to an Indian! The Hindi film industry is known the world over, for its stars, for the talent in them and the high glamour quotient of the celebs. Bollywood has surely come a long way, from the first silent film in 1913 to the present where entertainment drives the audience. Some of the indomitable pairs like SRK-Karan Johar, SRK-Yash Johar, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan-Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Ajay Devgn-Rohit Shetty, are the pride of this list. This combination plays an important role in leading to the success of a film, but there is no undermining the other contributors, ranging from cameramen to producers to spot boys who try their very best to make a movie, a hit.  Another aspect of this piece is the importance of connections that matters a lot in Bollywood. Here we are with a compilation of actor-director pairs who have given memorable and entertaining films together. These pairs continue to be great friends off-screen and this maybe something that has brought them success! The pretty obvious and deserving the first spot on the list, this friend cum actor-director duo has enthralled the audience with their right out-of-the-book portrayal of romance. In movies such as 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' to 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' to 'Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna' and 'My Name Is Khan'. The pair has also delivered dark plots, something beyond their comfort zone of lovey-dovey films!   David Dhawan, the director who has been known for his knack of directing fun filled, humour driven films with the desi touch of Bollywood, is best paired with Govinda. They have together made the audience roll on the floor laughing, in more than 16 ventures. Although the duo's charm lasted only till the early 2000s, we hope that they reunite to bring those natural peals of laughter back on our faces! Can't keep myself from mentioning my personal favourite, "Haseena Maan Jaayegi"!  Imtiaz Ali is a modern filmmaker who has tugged right at the heartstrings on the Indian millennials. In 'Jab We Met', he was so bang-on that the Indian youth could not keep itself from thronging the theatres. When the two young bloods, Ranbir and Imtiaz joined hands, we were blessed with the modern fables of 'Tamasha' and 'Rockstar'. We are looking out for many more of these endearing and relatable flicks.  This actor-director pair gave the audience an amalgamation of Indian culture and die-hard love. In movies like, 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' and 'Devdas', we were enticed by the aesthetics of Sanjay and the 'beauty queen', Aishwarya. But their latest collaboration in 'Guzaarish', was not well. The two have given films of a folk genre to their audience.  Hrithik debuted in the Hindi film industry with his dad's 'Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai' and grabbed attention to be soon called as the Greek God, for his sharp looks. Then came in the hits like 'Koi... Mil Gaya' and 'Krrish' series, which established them as a great pair in the minds of the people. They have together delivered blockbusters and have a cent percent success rate.  Films like 'Darr', 'Dil To Pagal Hai', 'Veer-Zaara', which have been masterpieces by this talented duo, are etched in our hearts for their stories and portrayal. The acting, the direction, the plot, they were one of the best amalgamations, to woo the moviegoers. Both of them have granted each other success, and the audience is never bored of watching their films, again and again.  This pair gave us some timeless and eternally romantic films for the audience. Their chemistry clicked at the right moment and we were lucky to have them in nearly 14 films together, with these- 'Shree 420', 'Anari', 'Andaz' and 'Barsaat', as unforgettable masterpieces.  'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (1995), the most-loved film of Shah Rukh's career, was directed by none other than Aditya Chopra, also his directorial venture. This film still lingers in the heart of every 90s kid. And since then, as they say, the rest is history, we had blockbusters like, 'Mohabbatein' and 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi', which were an epitome of love and romance. The Badshah and the 'silent genius' are beyond superb when they are together.  Kabir Khan has the forte of directing films on serious issues and still turning them into drama. Apt examples are 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan', 'Ek Tha Tiger' among many others. But these films were great crowd attractions while addressing some serious plots. Well executed, well crafted and brought out in the best envelope of emotions, direction and cinematography, Kabir Khan's films are not the ones one can leave in the middle! But, alas, the latest one, 'Tubelight' failed to carry forward that charm.   The camaraderie began in 2013 with the dark love drama, 'Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela' and has matured with 'Bajirao Mastani' to entice us soon on 17 November 2017, with 'Padmavati'. All of them, having the trio, Ranveer-Deepika-Sanjay! These movies created ripples with their historical storylines, elaborate sets and loaded star cast. We cannot wait to start the countdown for Padmavati, fascinated by their performances together.  We could not keep ourselves from including this rocking duo on our list here. From contemporary entertainers like 'Love Aaj Kal', 'Cocktail' to 'Tamasha', we have seen both talents get polished and grow over the years. Giving the Indian audience flavours of love and friendship, we adore this pair and desperately wish to see more of them together.  My favourite of all, Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani have together given some eye-opening films to the Indian audience. Not to forget some important life lessons from the flicks like 'PK' and '3 Idiots'. Let me confess here that the audience is anticipating more of these from you, guys! Are there any on the cards? I want to hear a YES!  Rohit Shetty, known for his humorous action packed movies, delivered it best with the veteran actor, Ajay Devgn. We cannot forget them in the Golmaal series, then came the record-breaking Singham and Bol Bachchan, which made marks on the minds of the audience as signature Rohit Shetty films. The flying, stumbling-over-each-other cars scene is an inescapable sight in his films, sometimes making us recognise the movie with the scene!  Two of my favs from Bollywood, 'Wake Up Sid' and 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' were a result of this talented pair. Off-work, they are close buddies, often spotted holidaying together, I guess this rapport is what gets the natural flair and expertise out of the two. Our love for the two does not seem to fade at all, in fact, seems to get deeper with their next!  Mr Bachchan, been there in the film industry for decades now, he has this modern director, R. Balki, who has provided him with films of out-of-the-box plots. Quintessentials are 'Cheeni Kum', 'Paa' and 'Shamitabh'. These have been path-breaking, and our hunger for this innovative genre of cinema has not been satiated yet! In fact, as full chances to give us the hunger pangs! We hope you enjoyed this compilation. If there are any more that you want us to include, you can surely list them in comments below. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 06 Jul, 11.28 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/catch+news+new-epaper-catchne/pravin+togadia+ends+fast+says+will+revive+hindutva+politics-newsid-86065957| Home Pravin Togadia ends fast, says will revive 'Hindutva politics' | Pravin Togadia ends fast, says will revive 'Hindutva politics' Former VHP leader Pravin Togadia ended his "indefinite fast" today, three days after he began the strike in Ahmedabad to press his demands, including the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, and said he would now embark on a nationwide tour to revive "Hindutva politics". Togadia, 62, said he was ending his fast on the advice of doctors. The surgeon-turned-firebrand leader accepted fruit juice from religious leaders to end the fast. Led by Akhileshwar Das Maharaj, the religious leaders had urged him to end his fast.  Togadia quit the Vishwa Hindu Parishad last week after his nominee lost a key organisational election. He had sat on fast on Tuesday to press his demands such as construction of Ram temple, deportation of illegal Bangladeshis, resettlement of Hindus in Kashmir, and abolition of Article 370 of the Constitution. Speaking to reporters, Togadia took a swipe at the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying they have proved to be "as bad as their predecessors" and failed to fulfil their promises. He said he would undertake a nationwide tour to take up the issues of "100 crore Hindus" and seek to revive "Hindutva politics" as the BJP government has failed to solve the problems facing the country. "People are now asking whom they should vote for, as those who gained power in 2014 proved to be as bad as those who were ousted. So I will try to establish Hindutva politics in 2019 to realise people's aspirations," Togadia said. "I will continue raising the voice of 100 crore Hindus by embarking on a pan-India tour from tomorrow. I will also take up the issues of farmers, labourers and the youth. I am sure that the Hindus, along with workers of the RSS, BJP and VHP, are still with me in my endeavour," he said. "Narendra bhai, you need to answer why promises were not fulfilled. If you don't answer, then 100 crore Hindus along with farmers and youths will seek answer from you in 2019. Instead of roaming around the world, try to solve the problems of the people of this county," he said. Togadia quit the VHP after his nominee Raghav Reddy was defeated by former Himachal Pradesh governor V S Kokje in an election for the post of VHP's international president.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/rvcj-epaper-rvcj/5+reasons+behind+the+downfall+of+kapil+sharma-newsid-85887582| Home 5 Reasons Behind The Downfall Of Kapil Sharma | Kapil Sharma, it is a name that needs no introduction whatsoever. This man is one of the best, if not the best entertainer the country has ever seen. Kapil Sharma is known for his hilarious sense of humor, his impeccable improv skills, and the incredible and brilliant comic timing. He has become one of the most popular faces in the history of Indian TV. The man faced a lot of difficult challenges, hustled his way into the industry, and through his hard-work and commitment to the art of comedy and entertainment, he managed to achieve exceptional success. When it comes to entertaining the audiences, when it comes to comedy, there's simply no one on par with Kapil Sharma. His work in 'Comedy Circus', 'Comedy Nights With Kapil', and 'The Kapil Sharma Show' will tell you why he is the undisputed king of comedy.   Also Read: 5 Motivating Life Lessons From 'The Kapil Sharma Show'  But lately things aren't bright for the comedian, as a matter of fact they look really dark. Something has happened to him, he's not feeling healthy which is one of the reasons why 'The Kapil Sharma' went off air. And even now when he's back with 'Family Time With Kapil Sharma', he's again cancelling the shoots of new episodes. So all is definitely not well in the professional and personal life of Kapil. The actor is again finding him in the center of controversies, he's having fights with his close friends, his co-stars leaving him. Kapil using foul language to address his fans on the social media and even accusing his ex girlfriend Preeti Simoes of allegedly extorting money from him. So what has happened to the man who once brought smile on our faces, who made us burst laughing to the point that our stomachs hurt because of it. 1. There's nothing wrong with being ambitious, everyone has the freedom to chase their passion, try out different things or experiment. His fans will always support him in his different business and career ventures. But he should never forget that his fans didn't fell in love with Kapil 'The Singer' or Kapil 'The Actor', they became his fans for his brilliant stand-up comedy talent. So he should focus all his efforts on comedy which made the people fell in love with him in the first place.    2. Never ever forget your roots. If you want people to respect you and admire you then you must also treat others with respect. Your pride and ego can cost you everything that you worked hard your entire life for. In the infamous flight incident, Kapil Sharma got furious at his team members over a silly thing and abused them. He even abused and allegedly threw a shoe at Sunil Grover who tried to calm him down.    3. Kapil Sharma needs to innovate not imitate. His act and jokes are not working anymore, audience needs something refreshing now. His way of making people laugh by insulting others and degrading other characters is getting old. Kapil's jokes are misogynistic, inhumane, and disrespectful at times.     4. It was reported that Kapil was in a drunken state when he assaulted Sunil Grover. Even Kapil has admitted using alcohol as a means to cope up with all the negativity around him. The comedian needs to defeat his inner demons and get back on the track. There's no shame in seeking medical help.    5. Kapil's downfall came shortly after he separated from his longtime manager and girlfriend Preeti Simoes. His ex girlfriend Preeti has expressed the desire to reconcile things and get back together, but she believes Kapil's ego won't allow that. She even believes that Kapil is suicidal and that his girlfriend Ginni Chatrath is responsible for the comedian's demise.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/business+world-epaper-bizworld/it+s+not+about+what+you+build+it+s+about+what+people+need+says+ajay+sakhamuri+myclassboard-newsid-68845112| Startups 'It's not About What You Build, It's About What People Need' Says Ajay Sakhamuri, MyClassboard | Technology and Education go hand-in-hand these days and educational technology can not be seen as a separate entity or two different terminologies, rather an inseparable combination believes Mr. Ajay Sakhamuri, the young entrepreneur, who has been formulating ways to transform education through technology. The manifestation of technology in the present era is apparent says, Ajay, recollecting the old days of how and when the seed was planted in his heart to build a technological product for schools. It was in 2007 when Ajay who was in his final year of graduation undertook a project on "Campus Express - An online onboarding site for all students at Penn," was the thought conceived to build a software for schools. Motivated by his father to work on the project, who himself was a business professional, influenced Ajay to dig deep into the technology. However, the project could not sustain due to lack of revenue clarity. Meanwhile, Ajay got recruited for Deloitte Company as a part of campus placements before he could finish his B.Tech. He joined Deloitte as an SAP ABAP consultant and worked there for almost 2 years.  With the seed still alive in him to build a school product, Ajay during his tenure in Deloitte, correlated the SAP technology to the educational stream. When SAP can help large businesses in growing by giving a global exposure, why not schools be enlightened with the same formula? This strong conception further persuaded the young entrepreneur to perform a market analysis on schools that are using technology. The outcome was that not many schools were into technology, and if any, they were using only excel sheets. The aftermath revealed that when using technology in schools there was a huge scope for technology infused products in the educational sector. Initially, there was Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model for schools to curb the need, despite which, schools were using offline methods. Ajay was strongly convinced that there was a dire need to solve the problem in the educational space and there was no key player to work on the same lines and develop a product that illuminates the schools. This triggered the determination in Ajay and he felt it was a good opportunity to think of the same in the vertical and bring out a solution becoming the first in the market to develop a school software. "It's not about what you build, it's about what people need," says the entrepreneur while speaking about the impact of technology in an Educational realm and the obligation for a school software. Continuing further, he says, the reminiscing history of Indian Education system has seen a gigantic transformation over the past decades. Starting with the ancient Educational system comprising the Gurukula system of education to the modern education system, the education system in India had witnessed a revolution. Stressing on the technological transformation in the educational sector, Ajay says, "India has become the second largest market for e-learning after the US. This depicts the changing face of education in India with technology becoming the most important ingredient in the field of education." The enthusiastic entrepreneur set out on a mission to build a product for schools that would pull them out from the intricacies involved in the school chores and also contribute to the technological development and educational metamorphism. The initial 2-3 years was focused on product development. After a series of strenuous efforts and unceasing groundwork from the Resource and Development team for two valuable years, the MyClassboard school management software product was carved out. During the construction phase, the team managed to build a strong product by cracking large school chains. Good marketing efforts and working with reputed school chains formed the basis to develop MyClassboard by giving it a frame. In 2009, MyClassboard stepped out of the ring to exhibit its product by offering a free pilot project in those selected large chains of schools. The bold step finally did pay off receiving valuable feedback from the associates following which the R&D team scrutinized the series of feedback collected, worked on them and further implemented the necessary changes and developed the product into a complete software. Only after that, Ajay shifted his focus to scaling product and schools. MyClassboard was now a finished product that attracted the eye of many. It did captivate the pilot clients to try the engineered software and become serious clients to MyClassboard. "This was the first and major step to our success path where our clients elated by our product services referred us to their peers," says Ajay. "Our pilot team then took our product to all those referred schools and no sooner they too became our clients by embracing our product." In a very short span of time, MyClassboard could make 100 clients only through a reference from its existing clients. The journey of MyClassboard towards a successful beginning started then by exposing the product to all schools across the nation starting with Hyderabad, Bangalore, North India, and North-East. It has been 8 years since MyClassboard began its steps towards the field of education and now here it stands with head held high in a business relationship with more than 1200 schools, benefiting over 9 lakh students through its value added services. Enabling its services to all schools, MyClassboard walked an extra mile by making its modules available as per the requirements of schools. The module-wise sales have put MyClassboard in the limelight. When many start-up companies or organizations struggle to make their survival during the initial phases, MyClassboard not only survived the competition but also made its existence known by setting up a province for itself in the market and becoming India's most widely used software. For all those willing to have a foretaste of the software, MyClassboard entertains them as well with a free trial service encouraging prospective clients to discern its unique services from others in the market. Making technology as the hub, MyClassboard has been constantly upgrading its software in tune with the emerging technologies to meet the global standards. Every year, MyClassboard has come up with a new version of the product making it user-friendly and perfectly feasible. Slowly yet consistently, MyClassboard could make a stand in the market simultaneously expanding its territory to Middle-Eastern countries as well. MyClassboard offers modules that every institution needs like Admissions module, Gradebook, Parent Teacher communicator, Attendance Tracker, Reporting Tool, Transport management application, Fee management application and many other feature rich modules. Apart from efficiently managing the school operations of all departments, MyClassboard goes much beyond than just being a school management software. It offers a suite of solutions that helps the school administrators in running the school efficiently and hassle-free. Ajay's MyClassboard has made a phenomenal progress since its birth in the field of education and has been equipping schools to reach their desired haven. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 12 Jun, 12.07 pm

The Jammu and Kashmir government on Thursday announced 3 per cent hike in dearness allowance (DA) for its employees and pensioners, effective July 2017. According to an order issued by the state's principal secretary finance, Navin Kumar Choudhary, the revised rate of DA would be 139 per cent after this 3 per cent increase. The finance department also said the arrears for July- December 2017 will be paid in cash to the employees and will form part of the salary from January 2018 onwards. According to the order, the enhancement in DA will also apply to the work charge/whole time contingent paid employees working in the regular timescale. State Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu had in his budget speech in the state assembly on January 11 this year announced release of pending DA and implementation of 7th Pay Commission recommendations in favour of the state government employees. He had also announced increase in the refreshment charges of the employees for working overtime during the legislature session from the existing Rs 7,500 to Rs 10,000.  "This is for the first time in decades that due to the fiscal stabilisation, the arrears on account of DA are being paid in cash," Drabu said. The minister said the far-reaching fiscal management measures initiated by the present government during the past three years have resulted in discernible stabilisation of the resource position, enabling the finance department to extend several monetary benefits to its employees and put in place various welfare initiatives for other sections of the society including industry, trade, agriculturists, horticulturists, women, girls, students, youth and destitute. "I am immensely thankful to the chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, and my cabinet colleagues for guiding me and providing me the support to initiate the welfare measures on such a large scale which have started bearing the fruit," he said. He said the present government has during the past three years announced a hike of around 35 per cent DA for the employees and pensioners besides increasing the Durbar Move TA from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 and Temporary Move Allowance from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per month.  Implementation of the 7th Pay Commission Recommendations from April 2018  "We are also implementing the 7th Pay Commission Recommendations from April 2018, ahead of almost all the states in the country," he said and added that the best part is the government ensured that the employees don't come out on roads even for a single day during the past three years to get these due monetary benefits. Drabu said in a latest decision, the government has also hiked the remuneration of the "daily rated workers" from the existing Rs 150 to Rs 225. "As already announced we are also in the process of regularising the daily rated, casual, seasonal and other workers and the process has already been set into motion," he said.     < Dailyhunt	|Friday, 26 Jan, 11.27 am3 weeks ago6 days ago

In an open letter published on The Wire late on Saturday, Swara has decried glorification of self-immolation customs Sati and Jauhar. She began her note by congratulating Bhansali for being able to release "Padmaavat" despite the hurdles-something she says she even fought trolls for on social media.  The actress, who played a small part in Bhansali's "Guzaarish", watched "Padmaavat" first day, first show", and decided to share her concerns as it left her "stunned". "That's what I felt like at the end of your magnum opus. I felt like a vagina. I felt reduced to a vagina-only. "I felt like all the 'minor' achievements that women and women's movements have made over the years - like the right to vote, the right to own property, the right to education, equal pay for equal work, maternity leave, the Vishakha judgment, the right to adopt children. All of it was pointless; because we were back to basics. "We were back to the basic question-of right to life. Your film, it felt, had brought us back to that question from the Dark Ages - do women - widowed, raped, young, old, pregnant, pre-pubescent. do they have the right to live?" Swara wrote. She stressed: "Women have the right to live, despite being raped sir. Women have the right to live, despite the death of their husbands, male 'protectors', 'owners', 'controllers of their sexuality'. whatever you understand the men to be. Women have the right to live - independent of whether men are living or not. "Women have the right to live. Period. It's actually pretty basic," she wrote, referring to the "very uncomfortable" climax scene in which actress Deepika Padukone (Rani Padmavati in "Padmaavat") leads a pack of women to commit self-immolation after attackers venture into their kingdom and kill the men. "Women are not only walking talking vaginas. Yes, women have vaginas, but they have more to them as well." Swara said she was hopeful that Bhansali would offer "some sort of a critique of Sati and Jauhar in your film". The daughter of well-known strategic analyst C. Uday Bhaskar and professor of film studies Ira Bhaskar, signed off the letter as "Swara Bhaskar, Desirous of Life". Her lengthy post did not resonate well with actress-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, who tweeted: "Aren't these feminist debates on 'Padmaavat' rather dumb? It's a story ladies - not an advocacy of Jauhar for God's sake. Find another battle for your cause-a real one at all. Not historical fiction." Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit wrote: "This is nothing but trying to grab eyeballs with zero rationale and logic. Swara Bhaskar has reduced a queen of brain and might to just a female body part. Does more harm to feminism than good." Producer Manish Mundra commented: "Now somebody takes fiction seriously and writes open letter about a story 100s of years old. The point is if you make a film from your past, do changes suitably to reflect today's feminism. "Both are in same boat-those who think a film can change their history and those who think a fictional film from past should be changed suitably to represent today's feminism."

He has expressed his heart out on various issues which include the infamous Tollywood controversy of Sri Reddy and her disgusting TV shows.   Pawan Kalyan in his press meet talked about the two rape cases which shook the entire nation. He opined that the Government of BJP should immediately respond and punish the culprits otherwise they are disrespecting Constitution. On the same note, he asked all citizens of India to change their mindsets such that they need to take the law into their hands if Forces fail to do justice. In Janasenani's views, The Centre is intentionally maintaining silence as the culprit belongs to their community and party. The press didn't leave Pawan to leave the meet without talking about Sri Reddy issue for which this dynamic leader not only advised the victim but also gave an indirect jolt to some media channels.    Pawan suggested Sri Reddy to approach Police and Courts for justice instead of debating on news channels for hours. He assured his support to her in case the law fails to do justice to her. Also, Pawan asked media channels to stop making everything sensational in order to get TRPs. Instead, he asked them to stand by the victims and question the Police in case they fail to attend Sri Reddy's case. On the same note, he declared that he can only advise for now as he is neither a Policeman nor a lawmaker to do justice to her. What Pawan said is completely true as each individual TV viewer thinks the same. A couple of TV channels are deliberately using controversialists like Kathi Mahesh and Sri Reddy for their TRPs in the name of support.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/live+mint-epaper-livemint/jio+propels+mukesh+ambani+to+world+s+greatest+leaders+list-newsid-86068422| Home Jio propels Mukesh Ambani to World's Greatest Leaders list |  New Delhi: Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani and human rights lawyer Indira Jaising have been named by Fortune magazine in the list of World's Greatest Leaders of 2018.   Fortune's 2018 ranking of the 50 greatest leaders released on Thursday also has architect Balkrishna Doshi in the list which includes Apple chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and football coach Nick Saban.  Ambani, who turned 61 on Thursday, has "in less than two years, brought mobile data to the masses - and completely upended the country's telecom market", Fortune said ranking him No. 24 behind likes of South Korean President Mon Jae-in, Chinese vice premier Liu He and French President Emmanuel Macron.  "Since Ambani, chief of the USD 47 billion conglomerate Reliance Industries, launched Jio-the first mobile network in the world to be entirely IP-based-in September 2016, the company has signed up a staggering 168 million subscribers. "The secret? Offering dirt-cheap data and free calls (and plowing billions of dollars into the infrastructure that transmits them). The effect, dubbed 'Jio-fication', has driven India's higher-price carriers to drop costs (if not run them out of business), and it fuelled a 1,100 per cent rise in India's monthly data consumption," it said.  On Jaising, founder, Lawyers Collective, Fortune said: "When the poorest in India need a voice, they find one in Jaising, a lawyer who has dedicated her life to battling injustice." Ranked No.20, she has fought on behalf of victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, helped Syrian Christian women in India win property rights equal to their male counterparts', and helped draft India's first domestic violence law, it said.  Her work has recently led her to Myanmar, where she was appointed by the UN to lead an investigation into the persecution of Rohingya Muslims, it said. The World's Greatest Leaders list started only in 2015.  The past lists featured global notables like Xi Jinping, Pope Francis, Jeff Bezos, Angela Merkel, Aung San Suu Kyi, Paul Ryan, Jack Ma, Milinda Gates, Gen HR McMaster, Sen John McCain, Janel Yellen, and Justin Trudeau.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi featured in the 2015 list while Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was on the 2016 Greatest Leaders ranking. The then State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya was on the 2017 list.  This year's list is topped by 'The Students' of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and other schools of US that witnessed gun violence. Ranking Doshi at No.43, Fortune said he is the winner of this year's Pritzker Prize, architecture's highest honour.  Doshi has spent the bulk of his 70-year career championing accessible housing, earning the moniker 'the architect for the poor'. "His designs include the Aranya low-cost housing project in Indore, a labyrinth of homes and courtyards that provide around 80,000 residents with a balance of open spaces and communal living, and the mixed-income Life Insurance Corporation Housing in Ahmedabad, where several generations of a family can occupy levels of the same building. Underlying all his work is the ideal that all economic classes deserve good housing," it said.  This year's list has the #MeToo Movement, which described the pervasiveness of sexual abuse, at No.3 behind Bill and Melinda Gates. Others on the list include tennis star Serena Williams, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Larry Fink who leads the world's biggest fund BlackRock, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher, film director Ryan Coogler, Tencent CEO Huateng 'Pony' Ma, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Oprah Winfrey, Chinese environmentalist Ma Jun, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian and 42-year old actor-producer Reese Witherspoon.

Recently, south actress Rakul Preet also said that in the south film industry there is no such thing as casting couch. Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 08 Apr, 11.28 am2 weeks ago3 days ago2 weeks ago2 weeks ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/edexlive-epaper-edex/instagram+fame+ted+the+stoner+talks+offence+laughter+and+why+he+memes+what+he+does-newsid-82645171| People Instagram fame Ted The Stoner talks offence, laughter and why he 'memes' what he does |      Jitendra Sharma aka Ted The Stoner is a Chartered Accountant from Mumbai, who, aged 23, runs one of the most popular Indian meme pages on Instagram, with 362K followers. Inspired way before the talking, pot-smoking bear from the movie Ted hit the screens, the account takes satirical digs through seasoned memes on NaMo, annoying Indian habits and a whole lot more. In 2015, the page was taken down by Facebook for being "offensive", but Ted's back at it again.The page, that surprisingly has a strong international fanbase, takes a generous dig at everyday Indian habits and governance with a dab of sarcasm and a pinch of humour.Ted's rule is simple - Do not follow me if you are easily offended! We caught up with Ted The Stoner and talked about his actual intentions - to spread common sense, awareness and a lot of good humour.   Excerpts from a 'memeingful' interview:     Who is Jitendra Sharma?  I was born and brought up in Mumbai and my life revolves around balance sheets and audits. I love writing in my free time and I also enjoy doing amateur sketches. We can be friends if you can share your pizza.Why 'Ted the stoner'? Was it meant to be some sort of secret identity?   Oh no. I never really felt the need to keep the identity a secret because initially it just started as a time-killing activity and I just wanted to explore what it's like to be on the other side of the curtain. What did you initially aim to do with the page when you started? Has it changed along the way?   It was probably 2 am when I created the page. I felt like there were very few pages that I could connect with on a humoristic level, so why not give it a try. Quality content was the initial aim, however, in 2015 the page was taken down by Facebook due to reasons unknown and then I switched to Instagram. After it got a massive boost, I thought 'why just stick to jokes when you can actually influence people and do something bigger'. That's when the rants began and it gained momentum after getting a few celebrity followers, but yes, the purpose did change somewhere down the line. Your page often analyses and highlights daily laxities in our country's functioning. A raging passion of yours?    I don't really find it difficult to express what is wrong with, or even appreciate our system. People like you and I just possess the knowledge of words. Like they say, words can spit venom or mend a broken soul. I do my best to use available resources for a greater good and try my best to make this world a better place. People do listen to everything you say when there is a crowd listening to you. But they will probably believe a lie even if a few thousand people nod in agreement. So, why not turn it around and let them see the truth for themselves?Is it hard to deliver that every day to thousands of followers?  It does get difficult at times when you touch upon a sensitive topic, but all I have learnt from this is that you cannot silence your inner voice just to please a few hundred people. If you believe that you are contributing to the good in the world, do not waste a second thinking about the backlash you will receive. It's all background noise. You are very critical of the government. Your thoughts on dissent and free speech, especially after your page was taken down?   I have always been critical of what I have felt is wrong, whether the problem was us as people or the government, in more than a few cases. I feel that we all have a role to play in the functioning of a modern society and we cannot simply be bystanders when we clearly possess the knowledge and education. Free speech is something I never really had a problem with, well, at least until the page was deleted. I shall continue to present my views/opinions and be unapologetic, while I shall always do my best to keep an open-minded discussion. But hey, no complains, no regrets.         Haters gonna hate: Receiving threats, allegations and offensive rebuttals have now become a way of life for Jitendra     Taking offense is our country's daily bread. For someone who dwells on offending conservatives through ' unsanskaari ' memes, how much does it take for you to not burst a vein?  I did get riled up back in 2011 when people did not agree with or got offended by my posts. Gradually, it became amusing. A year or two later, I found myself completely unaffected by what's happening on the internet. I only deliver my opinions and views. I don't think about the responses. I did enjoy offending conservatives a few years ago, but that is more of a byproduct now. I do my best to do justice to my bio, which claims to be changing mindsets. I honestly try my level best to educate people on the bitter truth rather than comfort them with a sweet lie. Some of the craziest responses or threats you've received?  Every response is crazy. Threats are usually funny because they usually come from 16 to 20-year-old teenagers. There was this guy who set up around ten profiles asking me for my address so that he could fight me. I finally gave him the CBI headquarters address in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). Haven't heard from him since. Humour and memes - what do you make of them?  Happiness comes in various forms. For some, it can be food or dogs or the people around them. I guess humour and memes are just another form of happiness. Everybody on this planet needs to have a good sense of humour. I mean, if we don't keep ourselves happy, who will? Memes are often used to target individuals personally. It is pathetic to actually bully someone you have no business with. These are mostly done by 15 to 18-year-old, self-proclaimed trolls with their own gag pages.      Meme boy: Ted aka Jitendra makes it clear that his page is not for those easily offended    Do you think you have loyal fans? What sort of a crowd do you cater to?   I know this sounds unbelievable, but I can safely put the hater: fan ratio to 1:1000. For every one hate message or comment, there are a thousand messages appreciating what I do. There are people who have always been supportive. I cannot really be bothered about haters because they're people I don't know. So in a way, I will never even know that I'm hated because I'm unaware of their existence. This is my wonderful logic. And I usually try my best to cater to a mixed audience and not a particular part of the crowd.      Support stream: Ted's followers, numbering around 380K followers, range from college students to young adults     Your views on the country's habit of deeming humour and satire a taboo, especially with regard to politics and religion?    I don't think I speak anything that is unique or different. I just speak what's on everyone's mind. A lot of us are just waiting to support someone who can pen down what they think. Mainstream media, politics and religion are a few topics which are always talked about in a hushed tone. We cannot shy away from these topics or silence ourselves because I believe that if we are capable enough to bring a change, create awareness or even rattle a few feathers, it becomes our moral responsibility to do so.   What do you draw inspiration from?   The biggest inspiration I draw would be from the people who have been ardently following me all these years. The consistent love and appreciation and above all, the satisfaction of seeing random strangers smile is the best feeling ever. Be it appreciation from someone serving our Indian Army, a kid going through a break-up, someone going through chemotherapy, every message I receive in support is beautiful in its own unique way. I do get extra happy when someone from the armed forces or someone suffering a terminal disease tells me that my page helps them smile. It is one of  the  greatest joys one can experience.     In your Instagram  bio , you mention changing mindsets. What is your plan?   I feel like my line in the bio is validated whenever someone messages me saying they felt differently about a particular topic but that they've changed after reading a rant on my page. At the end of the day, even if one person drops their conservative mindset, it's a victory for me. One step at a time I guess.       A little love: Ted's posts aren't all meme's and "offence" but also reaches out to fans with some extra love   Some of your memes could be considered offensive to certain groups and individuals. Are you sensitive to these factors while working?   (Laughs) Since this isn't really my work, I've honestly never given it much thought. I don't have a customer care department (for now). People can get offended by literally anything. I just post what I feel is right. I have my inner moral checks when I post. But I haven't changed my mind or refrained from posting something just because it would offend a section of people. I just make sure that I never personally hurt any individual with my posts. Some comedians/ people you draw inspiration from?  I appreciate the work of George Carlin, Louis C K and a few more. My mother is also a source of inspiration. Even if she's had a rough day, she always has this magical spark in her eyes and that positivity is contagious. I guess that is one trait I've picked up from her and I feel really lucky.   Where do you see the country heading to in terms of freedom and privacy? I'm pretty optimistic about our country's future because this is our time to do things, to bring change and be a part of it. We aren't spectators anymore. All these conservative party workers will vanish one fine day and we will actually be looking at educated and decent human beings in the Parliament. I believe in a better India. However, with recent advancements, I personally feel that privacy will be violated. On the other hand, I'm pretty optimistic about freedom of speech and I believe that things will go uphill from here. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 27 Feb, 2.13 pm2 months ago2 months ago2 months ago2 weeks ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/aalorukkam+movie+review+avoiding+stereotypes-newsid-85250590| Movie Reviews Aalorukkam movie review: Avoiding stereotypes |     Director: V.C. Abhilash Cast: Indrans, Sreekanth Menon, Vishnu Agasthya, Sameera Director: V.C. Abhilash  If you are in the practice of taking back with you one image of all that you have seen in a movie, and that image pops up whenever you think Aalorukkam, it is quite likely going to have Indrans in it - sitting on a wheelchair or walking around in Thullal costume or just staring out of a hospital window on lonely nights. The last is mine. It is difficult to imagine a frame without Indrans, even when other significant characters are all around him, even when he goes nearly mute in the last half of the movie - the exact opposite of the first half when as an old man found fallen on a road, the staff and the patients of a hospital find him to be a humorous, talkative and interesting chap with a sad tale.    He has come in search of his missing son, who as a lad had left home after an argument with his dad, 16 years ago. "I must have said something wrong. I didn't like his new friendships," Indrans as Pappu Pisharody says. Wheeled around by a young nurse or a bystander, he chats merrily with the young Seetha doctor, who ropes in her journalist friend (Vishnu Agasthya) to find the lost son. A policeman too tags along. As the search brings results, Pappu Pisharody is in for a shock. Revealing it would be a spoiler for the movie, but with the state award coming to Indrans for his role, the gist has been pretty much out there. The son has turned into a woman, with a family. And here, Sreekanth Menon does exceptionally well. Transgender characters in Malayalam movies are sometimes so exaggerated or made a mockery of, that Sajeevan turning into Priyanka with her colourful saris and motherly expressions is quite a relief. You forget there is any issue here, as you should, and Abhilash has done an exceptional job here to make it so. Avoiding the tiring old stereotypes. Pappu of course doesn't find it so - very natural for a 75-year-old man living with his old ways, seeing a woman instead of the son he had raised with his Sarojini. Indrans, like he does with every other serious character, seems to do this one with ease. But there is obviously a lot of hard work behind it, learning an art form entirely new to him. It doesn't seem too exceptional only because he has always been such a lovely actor. Every other actor - the son's partner (Shaji John), the little daughter (Baby Threya), the doctor (Sameera) and every new face - delivers lines so easily, flowing into the scene that nothing looks out of place or unnecessary; a mark of lovely scripting and editing here, and sensible selection of cast. Music flows through the movie, perhaps a tad too much, in the background and then as a song in the later half. Ronnie Raphael has put a 'naadan' folk touch to a song that makes Pappu reflect. He thinks too through the lovely shot of a rainy night when the son appears like in a dream, like a premonition. The movie questions without really asking if his love is large enough to accept. And perhaps that is as much a question to society as it is to Pappu. Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 08 Apr, 3.30 am

The College clarified that the professor had been suspended and an inquiry has been launched, however, the shocking clip has raised questions about the occurrence of soliciting on campus. While the professor, Nirmala Devi, a faculty member of Mathematics Department from Devanga Arts College, agrees that it is her voice on the clip she says that her words had been misconstrued. In the clip, she can be heard speaking to four students, asking them if they will consider doing a "big assignment". She says that doing so would help them get financial and academic support.  Here is the chilling transcript of the conversation- 1. I'm someone who knows everyone's secrets. So far we have shared a teacher-student relationship, now we have the chance to take it to the next level. 2.I have always supported you with regard to academics, now there is a big opportunity but it is something that we have to do in secret. If you do this, things on the academic front will change drastially for you without any difficulty. That is how high the officials involved in this assignment are. 3. What you have to do is complete "something" for them successfully. I can't go into more details but I trust you'll be able to understand. They've been requesting me for a very long time to do this. 4.If this gets out, it'll reflect badly on you. They've given me strong assurance. That's why I'm giving you this opportunity. 5.There is also financial support, more than you can imagine. It is your wish to tell your parents or not, depending on that we can discuss the amount. We will create a bank account and send you the money. 6. You can also pursue distance education or go to evening college, we will help you get into proper research and study. And you will also get a monthly salary. It is not necessary that you do any work. 7.( The students respond by saying they are hoping to get government jobs) Even to get the VC's post, you need influence. So when it comes to TNPSC exams you need influence as well. 8. If you don't like it, you don't have to do it but it's better if you think about it for two days before deciding. Such opportunities don't come easily. 9. There is big assignment coming next week and it involves a very high official. I can't name them but he is a very big official. 10. If you notice a recent video of mine with the 'governor', you can see that I've taken the video from such close quarters. Just by looking at that, you'll know how much influence I have. The clip has sent shockwaves across not just the academic world but the State in general. University officials claim that the issue is an attempt to malign the name of the institute, "This comes in the backdrop of the university constituting an inquiry committee at the level of syndicate sub-committee last month based on the complaints against the college management over misappropriation of UGC funds. The university will lodge a complaint against the college with the SP," the Vice Chancellor, P P Chellathurai said.

In the complaint letter, the KAS officer has named two ACB deputy superintendents of police Balraj and JK Anthony John as having pressurised him to give statements against Yeddyurappa. He stated that since he refused to bow into their pressure, he has been listed as no 2 accused in the case.     He also stated in his complaint that it was during his meeting with the officials on August 10 that this plan was hatched. He complained that despite he not making any statements, Balaraj dictated to the typist that the alleged denotification had been done by Yeddyurappa. When Basavarjendra objected to this, he claims, he was threatened by the two officials.    BJP Karnataka unit president B S Yeddyurappa on August 19 sought 10 more days to appear before the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in connection with an alleged illegal land de-notification case. The BJP and Yeddyurappa have alleged that the ACB is being used by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in the state to target the party in retaliation for the recent Income Tax department raids on Energy Minister D K Shivakumar. Yeddyurappa has been accused of de-notifying 257 acres of land from the preliminary notification of 3,546 acres meant for the formation of Dr K Shivaram Karanth Layout bypassing the de-notified committee approval, when he was the chief minister.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/india+today-epaper-indiatoday/reimbursement+part+of+salary+to+come+under+gst+a+rule+change+may+make+you+pay+more+taxes-newsid-85826826?s=a&ss=pd| India Reimbursement part of salary to come under GST? A rule change may make you pay more taxes | A large chunk of the reimbursement part of employees working in private sector may come under taxation net as the government is said to be mulling over bring "indirect earning" under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The relevant amendment in the GST rules may be discussed and approved in the next meeting of the GST Council. The idea of bringing reimbursements under the GST net flows from a recent ruling of the Authority of Advance Rulings (AAR) on canteen charges. The AAR ruled that the canteen charges recovered from an employee were to GST rates. This ruling may prompt employers to stop charging for canteen services in a bid to save taxes, which, in turn, is likely to impact the salary packages. The employers would not prefer to increase the cost to company for their employees.  In a case involving a Kerala-based footwear company Caltech Polymers, the AAR ruled, "recovery of food expenses from the employees for the canteen services provided by company would come under the definition of 'outward supply' as defined in Section 2(83) of the Act, 2017, and therefore, taxable as a supply of services under GST." Is the ruling going to impact other parts of reimbursement component of salary? "The decisions by the Authority of Advance Rulings are not binding on the GST Council. Both are independent of each other. The AAR works under finance ministry and has a lot to do with the Income Tax department while the GST is dealt with by a separate GST Council," chartered accountant Manindra Tiwari told Indiatoday.com. "However, the GST Council may consider the rulings given by the AAR while considering revision in GST rules. The logic is simple: the reimbursements are not taxed because they are claimed after expenses have been made and relevant taxes already paid. But, the counter logic is that reimbursements involve earnings made indirectly and hence should be taxed," Tiwari further explained. There has been an argument that the companies may be making recoveries avoiding taxes through salaries of their employees without issuing due invoices. "There is strong likelihood that some part of reimbursement may be brought under indirect taxation through GST," Tiwari said. If the GST Council agrees to expand the ambit of the GST to bring reimbursements under the indirect tax net, it is certainly going to burn bigger holes in the pockets of employees working in private sectors. So, reimbursements on home rentals, telephone bills, premiums for additional health insurance coverage, health check-ups, conveyance, gym, professional attires, entertainment or similar expenditure may attract GST. The corporates may soon be found restructuring salaries of their employees, to pass on the additional GST cost on to employees. ALSO READ Dailyhunt	|Monday, 16 Apr, 1.30 pm

Right? Mukesh Ambani is the most renowned businessman in India. He even comes in the list of leading successful people in the world. If we talk about the development Ambani Group has made, we all know that Mukesh Ambani left no stone unturned to achieve everything he has today. His hard work is the reason that today he stands at the point where he can have anything he wants. But even after being on cloud 9, he has his feet on the ground.  Looking at the lifestyle of Ambani family, you must think that they obviously enjoy their life to the fullest? Ambani being such a billionaire, his kids must have a royal life too. Right?  So, what I have brought for you people today is some inside information of Ambani family which will clear all your queries. Let's see what is the pocket money of Ambani kids. Mukesh Ambani is the most successful businessman among the Ambani group. And when it comes to the personal life, he is a successful father as well.   Mukesh and Nita Ambani have made sure to grow up their kids Isha, Anant and Akash in proper guidance to make them better human beings.   Though Nita is the wife of the biggest businessmen in the country, she makes sure that her kids don't get into the glamour of money. Nita herself is from a middle-class family and for going to her college or school, she used to take a local bus.   Rather than sending kids in their personal luxury cars, Nita Ambani used to send her kids to school by the public transport bus. This was to make them aware of the lifestyle and problems of a common man. "Life is about being aware of things around," says Nita.   During an interview in 2011, Nita revealed that "When my kids were still young, I'd give them Rs 5 each and every Friday to spend in the school canteen."   But one day...    "One day, my youngest, Anant, came running into my bedroom and demanded for Rs 10 instead," Nita said.    "When I questioned him, he said..."     "When I questioned him, he said his pals in school laughed whenever they saw him take out a five-rupee coin saying,'Tu Ambani hai ya bhikari!' Mukesh and I couldn't help but crack up," Nita added.   As I have already told you that Nita Ambani is from a middle-class family, she narrates, " My mum was a disciplinarian and we were barely allowed to go out - just four times in a year - and there was no pocket money given. Not to mention my curfew, which was midnight."   Before getting married to Mukesh Ambani, Nita always wanted to become a teacher. But after marriage, she got into the responsibility of the family.And you wouldn't believe how Nita's maids call her...  Nita Ambani, just like her husband has feet on the ground. An example for this is that the maids in her house don't call her Madam or Mrs Ambani, they call her 'Bhabhi'.  I hope you liked the story.  Got a story?

The incident happened almost a month back in Ramgarh district of Jharkhand. The dead body of the victim, who had gone missing since November 6th, was recovered with her hands and legs tied, near the bank of river Garna. The post-mortem confirmed the victim was gang-raped before being murdered. The police acted swiftly after the body's recovery and arrested the girl's lover, Adil, who made several revelations during an investigation. As per the police, the victim married Adil against their parents' choice last month and the couple reached his uncle's home in Bokaro. The uncle, in return, informed Adil's father and called him at his place. The couple, then were told by the father-uncle that since the girl is of different religion, she has to convert herself to Islam first. However, this demand was immediately turned down by the girl, after which the father offered to drop the duo to a nearest railway station so that they could head to Ranchi and live there. However, the father-uncle took the couple to a jungle route via Rajabeda Halt where they took turns to rape the girl and later killed her in the bushes. The girl's lover Adil told the police that while he resisted his father-uncle's motives, he too was tied by them while they committed the crime. On the other hand, the victim's family alleged that Adil's family misled them for over a month about the whole affair. Meanwhile, after the news spread, several Hindu groups protested against the murder and called it a case of love-jihad.Dailyhunt	|Friday, 29 Dec, 12.48 pm
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/u4uvoice-epaper-uvoice/jio+phone+s+android+version+coming+soon+5+things+to+know-newsid-75651122| Home Jio Phone's Android Version Coming Soon? 5 Things to Know | Yesterday came a report that Reliance Jio is killing the JioPhone and instead going to focus on a new phone, which will be cheap or even possibly "effectively free", that will run Android. In contrast the JioPhone runs on a version of Firefox OS - KaiOS is what Jio calls it. Although it is lightweight, the problem with the current JioPhone is that it can't run popular apps like WhatsAppp and Facebook. The report yesterday by FactorDaily noted that there is a rethink within Jio about its 4G feature. The report noted that Jio has halted the production of the JioPhone. Yes, the JioPhone is free. Or rather, it is effectively free. But if it can't run the apps that many people want, it may not help the company push it. Hours after the Factor Daily report came and other people started writing about the supposed end of JioPhone, the company came out with a statement. It said:  "JioPhone, India ka smartphone, is committed to fulfilling the country's digital vision. Jio welcomes the initial 6 million Indians who are moving to digital life with the JioPhone and will soon announce the next JioPhone booking date," said the spokesperson. So what does it mean? You must have seen many reports, based on this statement, saying that JioPhone production has not been halted. But that is interpreting this statement. It is not clearly mentioned that JioPhone production has not been halted in Jio statement. In fact, the statement is very vague.  To read between the lines, here is what we think is happening:  - There is indeed a rethink within Jio about the future of the JioPhone and strong chances are that a decision has been taken to alter the course. This is the reason why the JioPhone bookings were halted suddenly in August and since then have not been opened again. That is nearly two months since then, and yet Jio has not started the bookings. - The current focus within the company seems to be delivering the JioPhone that were booked earlier. - It is possible that after fulfilling these orders Jio may have a few more units of JioPhone with it. To sell them, the company may announce a limited booking process again. This could the reason why the Jio statement talks of next JioPhone booking date. - Nothing is final yet within Jio. It's just that they are thinking of the future direction for the JioPhone and are seemingly leaning towards Android for the future variant of the JioPhone as it will allow to run the apps that people want to run as well as compete with the likes of the Karbonn A40 Indian, Micromax Bharat 2 and Celkon Smart 4G that other telecom operators have announced along with bundled data plans. - It is important to note that if there is a pivot within Jio about the JioPhone, it doesn't mean end of JioPhone. It will only mean end of the JioPhone 4G feature phone. This is the reason why the Jio statement notes that "JioPhone, India ka smartphone, is committed to fulfilling the country's digital vision". This JioPhone can be any other. Jio can very well call the next version of device, which uses Android, with the same JioPhone name. - Just to summarise: The fact is that JioPhone rollout has been very slow. It was announced in July. It was opened to pre-booking for just a few days in August. Deliveries started just now for all the phones that were pre-booked, and even now most people haven't got it. It is clear that within Jio there are a few things that are holding the JioPhone back. Now we have a report that the company actually wants to move to a lean smartphone instead of 4G feature phone. The report makes a lot of sense, even though Jio's statement re-affirming its commitment to the JioPhone is not wrong.     Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 01 Nov, 2.25 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/mykhel-epaper-mykhel/liverpool+target+real+madrid+legend+casillas-newsid-85332902| Football Controversies Liverpool target Real Madrid legend Casillas | Bengaluru, April 9: Liverpool's search for a new goalkeeper has seen them linked with a shock move for Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas who is currently plying his trade at FC Porto in Portugal. The veteran stopper, 36, will be available on a free transfer at the end of the season when his contract at Porto expires. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is understood to be keen on signing competition for current number one Loris Karius. Liverpool have been extensively linked with a world-record approach for Roma's Alisson but it is understood the Anfield club are likely to turn their attentions elsewhere and that is mostly due to Karius' impressive display under the bar on a regular basis since he was awarded to start a run of games in succession.  The German has been impressive week in week out and that is why Liverpool are believed to be shifting their attention away from Alisson whose arrival would mean that Karius will be the second choice once again which would be harsh on him. Casillas, however, is at the dusk of his career and would bring a lot of experience if he moves to Anfield and can also help Loris Karius and Danny Ward to improve with his experience at the highest level. The Spanish legend could have more lucrative offers from China and America, but he is said to prefer staying in a more competitive European league. The Spaniard joined Porto in 2015 after a 25-year association with Real which began aged nine in 1990. Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp insists Emre Can's future remains 'open' and he has 'no problem' with the situation after joking the German international asked for £250,000-a week. The midfielder took to social media this week, seemingly in response to reports the contract stand off between player and club hinges on his demands for a £200,000-a-week deal. Can will be free to walk from Anfield on a Bosman at the end of the season, but Klopp believes nothing has been decided.

While April 27 is just a few weeks away, Marvel is elevating the excitement level of all the fans are increasing day by day. The release of the most anticipated movie of the year, the most ambitious crossover in the history of cinema... yeah, yeah, we have all seen the memes. Take it easy! With movie spoiler leaks on the rise, director brothers Joe and Anthony Russo have asked fans to refrain themselves from giving away any spoilers of the  Avengers: Infinity War , as doing so will not only ruin the experience for the audience, but will also be a huge setback for the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.  So to prevent the spoilers from spilling out and about, Marvel has only screened 30 minutes of the movie, that too for select cast and audiences, and the whole movie has not been shown to ANY of the cast members of this magnum opus. At the 30 min premiere in London, UK, Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays Doctor Strange) told Good Morning America that, "It was pretty hyped. It was wonderful. It was the same for us. We haven't seen hadn't seen the footage until last night, so we came out as fanned up as the fans. It was really, really exciting."  Tom Hiddleston, who plays Thor's brother Loki, went on to say that just a small portion of Avengers: Infinity War. He said, "None of us have seen the film and we'll be seeing it at the same time as you guys see it on April the 27th because there's so much about the film that's being kept under wraps, being kept secret. Last night was about 20 minutes and the first time I've seen it."  In another interview, Tom has further revealed, "...the reason they're not screening the whole film is because there are so many new things that happen in it - things that have never happened before in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - that it's just more exciting if everyone in the world sees the film at the same time... So that feels new for me, having been in the Marvel Universe for awhile."  While Black Panther is still running in the theatres, T'Challa is sitting on the throne of the third-highest grossing film in North American history, grossing over $665.4 million dollars in the domestic market, making both Disney and Marvel Studios proud of taking the high profiled leap.

Pray, who told her that? It's now the turn of Priyanka Chopra to be at the receiving end of trolling. This time, her comment is damaging, unlike Shilpa's laughable comment. "Sikkim is a small state in the North-east of India which never had a film industry or anyone who made films from the region. This is the first film ever that's come out of that region because it's very troubled with insurgency and troubling situations," the actress has said on the sidelines of an international film festival where her home production 'Pahuna' was filmed.  This has angered many Sikkim residents and as well as other Indians. It seems she thinks of it as a North Eastern State troubled by insurgencies like a Manipur. In reality, it's a peaceful State. "Such reckless comments can have a negative impact on the tourism industry," a resident of Sikkim remarks. "Priyanka Chopra is the Ambassador of Assam and calls Sikkim a small state from 'north east', troubled by insurgency! Seriously, dude?" a journalist says. The Bollywood actress has said sorry for her gaffe. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 14 Sep, 8.37 pm

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/curejoy-epaper-curejoy/5+reasons+why+it+is+important+to+wear+clean+underwear-newsid-76440933| Wellness 5 Reasons Why It Is Important To Wear Clean Underwear | Wear clean underwear. Isn't it something you were taught in childhood? Then why start unlearning the good things? Wearing clean, fresh, and washed underwear is something you need to do every day, just like the way you brush your teeth every morning, irrespective of how busy you are. There is no valid reason why you wouldn't do this on a daily basis. No, bathing doesn't make it any better! Bathing and wearing the same underwear is just as bad and wearing it inside out doesn't change anything either. Here are 5 reasons why you must ensure that you wear clean and washed underwear every day.  1. To Maintain Basic Hygiene    Practicing good hygiene should be an essential part of your life as it is important for good health. Taking a bath, brushing your teeth, and wearing washed clothes every day are all a part of your basic hygiene. Wearing clean underwear is primarily for your personal hygiene. Fresh underwear is free from microbes and bacteria that can have adverse effects on your health. 2. To Prevent Infections    Underwears help to absorb sweat, but not changing it on a daily basis can increase the risk of yeast infection as yeast and bacteria thrive in a moist environment. A dirty pair of underwear may have traces of feces on it. The bacteria from the fecal matter can spread to your urinary tract, resulting in a urinary tract infection. To prevent infections, you need to ensure that you wear clean, dry underwear each day. 3. To Prevent Rashes    Your skin may turn itchy if you have been sitting in the same underwear and clothes for a day or two. What starts with just an itch can soon turn into a rash or sore. Although these rashes can be treated easily, it is always better to prevent them by wearing fresh and bacteria-free underwear. If you notice a rash, clean the area and ensure that you start changing your underwear regularly. If it still doesn't heal, visit your doctor at the earliest. 4. To Keep You Comfortable    How do you feel when you have a shower and put on clean clothes? It is certainly better than the way you felt before you cleaned yourself. The dirt, sweat, and bacteria can make you extremely uncomfortable. Additionally, it can have a negative impact on your sexual life. Not only will the stains and itch make you and them uncomfortable, the other person is also put at the risk of an infection due to your negligence. 5. To Maintain High Self-Confidence    You must have noticed a strange odor from down there. This is a sign for you to change. Although the vagina cleans itself, the other parts remain dirty and need to be kept clean. This unpleasant smell and infection caused due to dirty underwear can affect your self-confidence as you may hesitate to have a social interaction. The fear of other people smelling the foul odor can keep you from talking to them.  It is always better to stick to cotton underwear instead of silk or nylon ones. Cotton underwears let your skin breathe and prevent infections. Wearing tight underwear can lead to an infection as the moisture is trapped. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 16 Nov, 6.46 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/punjab+woman+on+pilgrimage+converts+to+islam+marries+pak+resident-newsid-86074060| Top Stories Punjab woman on pilgrimage converts to Islam, marries Pak resident | A 31-year-old woman from Punjab's Hoshiarpur district, who went on a pilgrimage to Pakistan on April 12 ahead of Baisakhi festival as part of a delegation, has reportedly converted to Islam and married a Pakistan national based in Lahore. The woman Kiran Bala, a widow, has three children and was staying with her parents-in-law in Punjab. Her husband died in 2013. Kiran's father-in-law, Tarsem Singh, on Thursday added a new twist to the entire episode while expressing fear that his daughter-in-law may have fallen into the hands of Pakistan's ISI. He claimed that she was forced to convert to Islam.  The woman was a part of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) delegation that left for Pakistan on April 12. She went missing for four days in Pakistan. Now, she has applied for an extension of her visa in Pakistan, claiming a threat to her life in India, media reports said. Kiran's Pakistan visa will expire on April 21. According to reports, the woman converted to Islam from Darul-Aloom Jamia Naeemia in Lahore on April 16. Later, the marriage was solemnised with one Muhammed Azam, a resident of Lahore. She now has a new name - Amna Bibi. Hundreds of Indian Sikh pilgrims had gone to Pakistan on the occasion of Baisakhi on April 13 to visit historical Sikh shrines, including Panja Sahib Gurdwara near Lahore and Nankana Sahib Sikh shrine, which is the birthplace of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev. The pilgrimage to Pakistan has seen controversies over the week with officials of Pakistani agencies denying permission to Indian embassy officials based in Pakistan to meet the visiting delegation. The family said they have not been contacted officially by the SGPC or any authority to authenticate the information pouring out of media reports.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/investment+guru+india-epaper-invgur/top+5+scooters+at+auto+expo+2018+honda+activa+5g+tvs+ntorq+and+more-newsid-81673106| TOP STORIES Top 5 Scooters At Auto Expo 2018: Honda Activa 5G, TVS NTORQ And More... | The Auto Expo 2018 was packed with new launches, unveils and interesting showcases, of which, the majority was comprised of scooters. Before you hit the Expo this weekend, we bring you a list of the top five scooters at the Auto Expo 2018.  Aprilia Storm 125  The Aprilia SR 150 is certainly one of the sportiest scooters in India today, but it is also priced towards the premium end of the spectrum at Rs 70,939 (ex-showroom, Pune). In order to grab hold of a larger audience, Aprilia launched the SR 125 at Rs 65,310 (ex-showroom, Pune) and unveiled the Storm 125 . In terms of styling, both the scooters looks similar to the Aprilia SR 150.  But the key difference between the Storm 125 from the SR 125 is the wheel size. The Storm 125 sports 12-inch wheels instead of the 14-inch ones seen on the SR range. That said, these are the fattest tyres seen on a scooter, with the front being a 120/80 section rubber, while the rear gets a 130/80 section tyre. Other difference includes bright colours and funky new graphics. It will also come with different optional accessories such as a large windscreen.  Powering this scooter is a 124.49cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine sourced from the Vespa VXL/SXL 125. Mated to a CVT transmission, the Storm 125 delivers 9.65PS of power at 7,250rpm and 9.9Nm of torque at 6,250rpm. Suspension duties are carried out by telescopic front forks and an adjustable rear monoshock. As is the case with SR branded scooters, the Storm also gets a disc brake up front, with a drum brake at the rear. Once launched, we expect the Storm 125 to be priced at approximately Rs 67,000 (ex-showroom).  Honda Activa 5G  Honda unveiled a total of 11 models at the Auto Expo 2018, one of which was the new generation Activa 5G. The scooter has received a few subtle updates for the new year. Honda also introduced an additional variant of the scooter, known as the 'Deluxe' variant wherein, along with the standard features you also get a semi-digital instrument console which shows ECO options and service due indicator. The standard features include an all-LED headlamp - a feature that was first introduced by the Honda Grazia in the segment -, chrome inserts on the front apron and two new colour options - Metallic Yellow and Red. Other than that, the scooter remains unchanged.  It is still powered by the old 109cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine, which produces 8PS of power at 7,500rpm and 9Nm of torque at 5,500rpm. With the few modern touches, the Activa 5G certainly adds a dash of freshness over the Activa 4G that it replaces. Prices aren't announced yet, but we expect the new model to be available at a price hike of around Rs 1500 over the Activa 4G that costs Rs 51,460 (ex-showroom, Delhi).   Suzuki Burgman Street  Suzuki also made its presence felt at the Auto Expo 2018 by unveiling the Suzuki Burgman Street. In terms of design, it sports a maxi-scooter inspired look with its large windscreen and split LED headlamp placed within the front apron, on top of the mudguard. The fully-digital instrument console sits right in between the handlebar and the windscreen. There is a multi-function key slot, generous underseat storage and a 12V charging socket as well. The rider seat section is slightly tapered down, whereas the pillion seat looks broad. At the rear, it sports a single-piece grab rail and a single-piece cluster consisting of an LEDtaillight and side indicators. It packs the same engine that is seen on the Suzuki Access 125. This 124cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder unit produces 8.7PS of power at 7,000rpm and a peak torque of 10.2Nm at 5,000rpm. With the Burgman range available internationally, Suzuki has always focused on comfort. So expect the Burgman Street to offer the same in India. To the same effect, the Burgman Street features telescopic forks up front and a monoshock at the back. The 90/90-12 front tyre gets a disc brake, while the 90/100-10 rear wheel is bolted with a drum brake. Suzuki is expected to launch the Burgman Street soon. Expect it to be approximately Rs 7,000 costlier than the Suzuki Access 125.  2018 Aprilia SR 150  The Aprilia SR 150 has been updated for 2018. These updates include new livery for the 'Race' variant, new colours including a Carbon Se edition for the standard model and a semi-digital instrument console. Other than these changes, the scooter remains unchanged mechanically and cosmetically. It packs the same 154.8cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine, which delivers 10.5PS of power and 11.4Nm of torque. The 2018 model will most likely replace the ongoing SR 150 and will be priced the same at Rs 70,939 (ex-showroom, Pune).  TVS Ntorq 125  Just a day before the Auto Expo 2018, TVS launched its first ever 125cc scooter - the NTorq 125 - at a price of Rs 58,750 (ex-showroom Delhi). The scooter is edgy and has been designed to look sporty to attract many young buyers. It certainly has taken a lot of inspiration from the Graphite concept that was showcased at the Auto Expo 2016. The NTorq 125 is also the first Indian scooter to get Bluetooth connectivity. Its fully digital instrument console hosts a total of 55 features including navigation assist, a lap timer, engine oil temperature, top speed recorder, last park location assist and a service reminder to name a few. Powering the scooter is an all-new 124.79cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder motor. It churns out 9.4PS of power at 7,500rpm and 10.5Nm of torque at 5,500rpm. Suspension duties here are handled by telescopic forks up front, while the rear houses twin gas-charged shock absorbers. Braking is done via a front 220mm disc and a rear 130mm drum brake. At Rs 58,750, the TVS NTORQ 125 scooter comes across a great value for money option since the Honda Grazia, its closest rival, is priced at Rs 58,155.

The show is running since 28 July 2008 on SAB TV.  The show is a light-comedy TV series which is inspired from the famous Gujarati writer Taarak Mehta. He wrote series of stories titled, "Duniya Ne Undha Chashma."  Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah has been a big hit on the Television because of the funny plot it follows, its quirky characters, excellent script and brilliant direction. Every character in the show has a unique identity, and viewers love them.  Of late, many prominent actors from this serial have quit it for some or the other reason. Dayaben aka Disha Vakani is in the news for leaving the show, check out the reason.  Raj Anadkat, 19-year old Mumbai resident, has now entered the show. Bhavya Gandhi, popularly known as Tipendra Jethalal Gada aka Tapu has quit the show. After eight years, the young actor decided to do something new and challenging and therefore left the show.  Mr and Mrs Bhide's daughter is Sonu in the TV show. Jheel Mehta played Sonu's role. Jheel Mehta was replaced by Nidhi Bhanushali in 2012. One of the reasons why Jheel decided to quit was that she wanted to focus on her studies. Also, she had become too tall to play Sonu's role.   Gurucharan Singh, best known as Sodhi, left the serial due to differences with the producer of the show, Asit Modi. Laad Singh Maan replaced the Sardar. But they (Asit Modi and Gurucharan) cleared the differences and Gurucharan made a comeback as Sodhi again. As a result, Laad exited the show.  Mrs Roshan's role was played by Jennifer Mistry. She quit the show because she was pregnant and was replaced by actress Dilkhush Reporter in 2013. In 2016, Jennifer got back to the show.  Disha Vakani aka Dayaben is the show's star attraction in Taarak Mehta Ka Oltah Chashmah. Her maddening jokes and queer way of speaking have made her a favourite of viewers.  The reports by DNA India says that Disha is pregnant with her first child and will go on maternity leave soon.  Dayaben will not quit the show. She will be back soon after she delivers her baby.But we will miss her. After all, her perky character has won our hearts, and it would not be easy to watch the show without her, isn't it?  The question now is whether Vakani's absence will affect the show's TRP? Time alone will tell. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 12 Jun, 6.04 am

Love is the second name of shah jahan and mumtaz. Shah jahan constructed Taj for his beloved Mumtaz as she died in her 14th child birth. But we are unaware from the facts of the beautiful monument and the people related to it. Here are some unknown and uncommon facts of that era and great emperor Shah Jahan and his beloved Mumtaz.    Taj Mahal was not built and designed to entomb a second person other than Mumtaz Mahal. Aurangzed decided to bury his father's body next to Mumtaz Mehal instead of building another monument for is father.     Shah Jahan was laid next to his beloved wife Mumtaz in Taj Mahal also called as Mumtaz Mehal.    There was no state funeral for Shah Jahan after being a great king also.     Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his younger son Aurangzeb as he was afraid that his father won't give him the throne. Rather the throne would be given to his elder brother. Therefore for the greed of occupying the throne , Shah Jahan was house arrested by his younger son.      Shah Jahan's sons apparently fought a battle called the battle of Samugarh against each other for the crown.      Shah Jahan married mumtaz sister after her death. This is really wondering if he loved her truly.      Mumtaz was his 4th wife and he was already married 7 times. Mumtaz had married another man who was apparently killed by shah jahan so that he can marry mumtaz.      Full name of Shah Jahan as an emperor was "Shahanshah Al-Sultan al-'Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram, Malik-ul-Sultanat, Ala Hazrat Abu'l-Muzaffar Shahab ud-din Muhammad Shah Jahan I, Sahib-i-Qiran-i-Sani, Padshah Ghazi Zillu'llah, Firdaus-Ashiyani, Shahanshah-E-Sultanant Ul Hindiya Wal Mughaliya.

We should not feel that nothing is in my hands. If an officer feels like that, what will the common man do?"   - IAS Rohini Sindhuri Dasari   Whether it was locking down the office of A Manju, the Minister-in-charge of the Hassan district, or raising a voice against her untimely and abrupt transfer, firebrand IAS officer, Rohini Sindhuri, isn't afraid of authority. Time and again, this gutsy officer has made headlines not only for running successful campaigns in the districts she was posted to but also for standing strong as a gritty and determined role model who refuses to bow down under political pressure.  Here's all you need to know about IAS Rohini Sindhuri:  The 33-year-old IAS officer was born on 30 May 1984 in Andhra Pradesh. She graduated with a B. Tech in Chemical engineering from the University of Hyderabad. An IAS officer from the batch of 2009, she secured the 43rd rank in the UPSC exam. She first assumed charge as the Assistant Commissioner of Tumakuru from 29 August 2011 to 31 August 2012. She then moved on to become the Commissioner of the Urban Development department in the district for short term from 31 August 2012 to 31 December 2012. Following that, she was appointed the Director of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department, Self Employment Project in Bengaluru for a year. She assumed charge as the CEO of Mandya Zilla Panchayat in May 2014 where she is widely known for her exceptional work under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Her work impressed the Union government enough to select her to train district collectors/deputy commissioners of various states in New Delhi on implementing Swachh Bharat initiatives. She later served as the Managing Director of Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Limited in September 2015, in Bengaluru, until she was appointed as the District Collector of Hassan district in July 2017.  Work and Accomplishments As the CEO of Mandya Zilla Parishad, Rohini successfully launched a drive to provide individual toilets to over 1.02 lakh households between 2014-15. She managed to construct over 80,000 individual toilets across the district, which helped it clinch the number one position in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in the state and rank third in the entire country. Rohini was also lauded for successfully utilising the Central government's grant of Rs 65 crore for drinking water. Alongside her team, she instituted over a 100 pure drinking water units across the district. Her work impressed the Union government yet again and earned the district an additional grant of 6 crores to widen the reach. One of her popular strategies to help people in the Mandya ZP inculcate good sanitation measures was the Munjaane programme, where Rohini would personally meet the villagers early morning and promote the cause of constructing individual toilets. She was also praised by the CM Siddaramaiah at a meeting of Deputy Commissioners and Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive officers for executing a crop survey in connection with farmers' crop insurance scheme in November 2017. Fighting political bureaucracy However, just like many honest IAS officers, her journey to success has been anything, but easy. As the District Election Officer, Rohini recently made headlines, when she locked down A Manju's office in the PWD Inspection Bungalow. He is the Minister-in-charge of Hassan district and the office was reportedly locked from outside while some staff members continued to clear pending files inside. Rohini issued notices to the minister as well as the PWD Department for using government space for election work which is a violation of the Model Code of Conduct and is effective from the declaration of poll dates. Needless to say, her clashes with political personalities are being termed one of the reasons for her abrupt transfer. That being said and done, the IAS officer isn't giving up. She is fighting for her right to stay and continue the work she painstakingly started in the district.   READ MORE:    Fighting against her transfer Rohini challenged the state government's decision to transfer her in January merely eight months after she was appointed as the Deputy Commissioner of the Hassan district. She appealed to the Karnataka High Court and the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) for the same. After the Election Commission requested the state government to postpone her transfer until the final publication of electoral rolls, her transfer order was withdrawn on March 5. However, it only took 48 hours for the same transfer order to be re-issued. The HC recently directed the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Bengaluru, to examine the application Rohini filed against her transfer after it was brought to their notice that despite asking her to submit a representation to the chief secretary, the CAT did not take any decision on it. And her battle continues. In an interview with the Bangalore Mirror, Rohini recollected a similar instance in the past where she was abruptly transferred from Mandya, and said- "I was doing very well, and it was just one year, three months and some random guy was complaining about something. When they can't find anything, they'll say 'Gaurava Kotilla' [did not get respect]. What does it even mean?.We are here to solve people's issues. We were supposed to declare the district Open Defecation Free, and I had only requested for two to three months so that I could finish the work. But they wanted to know what my interest was in staying." She expressed the challenges IAS officers face when they get posted to a district and are transferred prematurely saying, "By the time you put an administration in place, form a team and start working, you are asked to leave. I want to work, and I should be given the time and space to do something." While most officers in her place abide by the rule book and pack their bags to move to another place and start from scratch, Rohini's is embarking on the road less taken. "When we have the legal backing that says we need to be given a tenure in public interest, then that has to be respected. Nobody is above the law," she told the Bangalore Mirror.  IAS Rohini truly shines as a beacon of light for women who want to establish themselves in the civil services and do not lose focus of their jobs even in the face of political pressure.

"SBI has a total of 6.08 lakh PoS machines of which 4.78 lakh PoS machines are enabled to dispense cash to the customers of SBI and the banks who have enabled this facility for their customers," the bank said in a statement.  The development comes just a few days after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley sought to allay fears amidst reports of a cash crunch and empty ATMs in the country by stating that "there is more than adequate currency in circulation", even as the government blamed "unusual demand" for shortages in some areas.  Besides, the central government announced that it has decided to increase printing of Rs 500 notes by five times. In addition, the RBI said that it is "taking steps to move currency to areas" which have witnessed unusually large cash withdrawals. "The shortage may be felt in some pockets largely due to logistical issues of replenishing ATMs frequently and the recalibration of ATMs being still underway. RBI is closely monitoring both these aspects," the RBI had said in a statement on Tuesday. "Further, as a matter of abundant precaution, RBI is also taking steps to move currency to areas which are witnessing unusually large cash withdrawals." Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 8.14 pm

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/royal+enfield+motorcycles+the+good+the+bad+the+ugly+things+about+owning+one-newsid-83579016| CarToq Royal Enfield motorcycles: The good, the bad & the ugly things about owning one | Well, there are motorcycles and then, there's the Royal Enfield. With its roots at The Enfield Cycle Company Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire, this South India-based motorcycle manufacturer enjoys a cult status in India. However, all is not hunky-dory with their motorcycles. Here's a look at the good, the bad and the ugly things about Royal Enfield motorcycles. The GOOD  1. Retro Appeal - One of the biggest selling points of these motorcycles is their high retro appeal. The basic design of most of the Royal Enfield motorcycles has been unchanged since time immemorial. All this means that you get classic looks that are on the verge of becoming eternally timeless.   2. Loads of Character - Royal Enfield motorcycles are high on character. There are many who won't settle for anything but a pure mechanical feel. The turbine-like smoothness of the modern-day Japanese motorcycles just won't cut it for them. The loud thump of a Royal Enfield motorcycle, the metal panels, and the many classy bits like an analog speedo - these are just some of the many bits that give these motorcycles a distinctive nature.  3. Comfortable - There's no denying the high comfort levels that these motorcycles have on offer. The seats offer just the right amount of cushioning, enough support and can easily keep you comfortable over long rides. Another major highlight here is the correct ergonomics. Thanks to their simple design, the ergonomics are just spot on, especially for the well-built and the tall ones.  4. Innovative Products - While all that retro charm has been working really well for this South India-based company, it doesn't look like the boffins at RE are the ones to sit on their laurels. In spite of all the success that the Classic and the Bullet range of motorcycles enjoy, the company, of late, has been regular with bringing in new products (Read: Continental GT, Himalayan, Thunderbird X). Oh, and we really can't wait to get our hands on the upcoming 650cc twins. The BAD     1. Pricey - With prices of the Royal Enfield range starting at roughly Rs 1.13 lakh, the REs are much pricier than a major chunk of motorcycles on sale in the country. More than the high pricing, it's actually the lack of features and new technology that make these products look a bit exorbitantly priced.  2. Poor quality of parts - Admit it, a high-quality control has never been RE's forte. The quality of parts, in spite of some improvement in recent times, hasn't been anything to write about. Many parts are prone to break or fall apart while the paint fades away much quicker, too.  3. Poor Safety levels - The Himalayan is the only Royal Enfield motorcycle that offers ABS. Every other motorcycle, including the recently launched Thunderbird 350X and 500X, don't offer ABS. Also, earlier REs are (in)famous for their poor brakes. Improving safety levels is one area where the manufacturer should really focus.  4. S-L-O-W - Many 350cc models of RE are even slower than the likes of the much cheaper Bajaj Pulsar 180. Even the now-defunct Continental GT 535, which is easily the sportiest RE we've seen so far, has a top speed of just about 130 kmph. The UGLY     1. Horrible Quality Levels on 'new products'- The worst thing about Royal Enfield is that the manufacturer just won't improve its quality levels. Even the newer bikes, like the Himalayan, are marred by poor quality check and sub-standard parts. In fact, Royal Enfield had to replace a large quantity of parts on the Himalayan even after the motorcycles reached customers.  2. Reliability - To be fair, we acknowledge the higher reliability of the newer REs. However, these motorcycles still have a long way to go before their reliability is comparable to that of even motorcycles from Bajaj or TVS. This is something that's quite a put-off, especially when you take into account the high price you pay to buy these motorcycles.

From Nirbhaya to Asifa to many unknown girls in the country, who get raped, sexually molested and eve-teased every day. What do we expect from a government who punishes on killing a cow or a deer, but takes months and years to punish a rapist? This is India. India kills people for eating beef, for killing cows but doesn't care if someone rapes and kills our girls. India worships female goddesses and also molests and rapes a girl as young as a few days old.     Image Source  Yes, we don't expect anything from the government or at least this mother doesn't, who bravely entered the mosque and beat a Maulvi to his sanity, who sexually molested her 8-yr-old daughter.  This mother doesn't want her 8-yr old daughter to go through the same situation as the victim of Kathua rape case has faced, an incident which has shaken the whole nation with shame. And thus, fiercely entered the mosque along with her daughter, with a stick in her hand, and beat him insanely in front of everyone. Mother of a 8 years old girl entered into the mosque and beating the Molvi for molesting her daughter, proud of her 💕 pic.twitter.com/IoVVKOA9OE— Cognitive Dissonance (@She_Contradicts) April 15, 2018  The incident is of Pakistan, where other maulvis present in the mosque joined the mother and beat him up for his abhorrent act. The mother even encouraged her daughter to fight for herself by handing him the stick to beat her accused. The mother, indeed, taught him a good lesson. The video was shared by an internet user, after which it went viral, being re-shared by many people. But is this really the way justice should be served? She’s not hitting him hard enough in my opinion— 🍂 (@ahlvm) April 15, 2018  While many people also opinionated that everyone deserves a chance to prove themselves, even the Maulvi. No. But don't you think everyone deserves due process?— ~ (@husayn232) April 15, 2018   Kids that young wouldnt even know to make that up , come on use your head dude— K (@ppeachy2) April 15, 2018  Everyone does deserve a chance to prove themselves, even the Maulvi in this case.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/daily+post-epaper-dpost/alum+benefits+for+skin+and+hair+problems-newsid-71735226| Top News Alum benefits for skin and hair problems |  Alum benefits for Skin and hair problems. You have heard about the benefits of Alum from elders. Alum is also used in many skin problems. It not only makes you beautiful, but also helps to make your hair black and whiter your skin. Let us know about the advantages of Alum.  Alum for canker sores: Alum powder is used to treat canker sores easily. Just place a pinch of alum powder on top of the sore and leave it for 30 seconds. Wash it off thoroughly. Repeat this for 2-3 times daily till the canker sores go off. You will get complete cure mostly within 3 days.  Alum for dark circles: Many commercial brands started using alum powder in their product for curing dark circles. You can mix a pinch of alum powder with water and apply it on the dark circles. Take care not to apply on the eye. Please do it carefully.  Bleeding cuts: A few research has shown that this one even has the ability to deal with the bleeding cuts. You are able to spread the alum residue on such cuts to prevent an additional loss of blood. But here, remember that in case your cut is just too deep and also the bleeding is simply not stopping, then you'll need some professional medical help. And so, during that time, don't just depend on an alum residue.  Alum for Hair Removal: Alum is traditionally used for hair removal. Women in historical ages utilized alum for removing unwanted facial hairs just like upper lip hair. Mix 1/2 tsp of alum powder along with 1 tsp of rose water and keep it ready. Adjust the amount of alum powder as well as water as needed. The ratio of alum powder to rose water is 1:2 roughly. Once hair is removed or even waxing is completed, use the alum mixture on the face or even the place where you would like the facial hairs to be removed. Let it rest for 20 minutes. If you feel that the mix gets dried up, you are able to sprinkle rose water on it to help keep it on more time. Clean thoroughly and pat the face dry. This can be done on your hands and legs too. Use moisturizer after pat drying to keep the area moisturized. Regular coconut oil can be used as moisturizing. Try not to apply around the eye as well as surrounding areas.  Alum for Body Odor: Once your body releases sweat, the food compounds in sweat attract bacteria that leave uncomfortable smell right after feeding on these compounds. Use alum block on pre-washed arms on alternative days. Anti-bacterial as well as germ killing qualities living in alum will combat and restrain bacterial infection.

Who doesn't know about the red-light areas that exist in India? What are the able to do about them? The worst part of this scenario is that most of the women in India are forced into prostitution since a young age as they grow up; they have no other choice then to continue with that for money as there is literally no escape from the "sex-market" industry like that. A lot of women in India have no other choice other than joining the prostitution industry for earning money because a lot of problems which they have to go through. It's nothing as we assume it to be because the dark side of this market is worse than we can imagine.  Here are some of the confessions by prostitutes and the agony of their lives will make your heart fall apart. Confessions by prostitutes -  Victim 1: I was forced into prostitution because I belonged to the third gender. My family chucked me out of their house because according to them I was bringing a bad name to their family. I had no other option than to leave my house. I met a man once and he said that he'll give me money and food only if I agree to do what he says. As I had been hungry since 3 days I agreed. He did everything that he could have done with a sex-worker. I felt a lot of pain but became numb after sometime. He took me to a place where there were many like me. Since then I have been a part of the sex market in India.  Victim 2: I was 11 years old when my parents sold me to a man for five thousand rupees as my father was in debt. The man took me a dingy looking place full of unpleasant women and some men. I couldn't understand anything that time. I was made to sit down in one of the small rooms which gave me a hint that something wasn't right. A lady came to me saying that wear these clothes and be ready for your first customer. I did as she said as she was really scary and angry. After some time I saw a middle aged man coming towards me. He pulled me closer and banged me on the bed. He got on the top of me and started removing my clothes. I shouted and he slapped me, which made me keep quite. He got into me and crying was the only option I had. I kept on crying in pain and he left after some time after finishing with what he wanted to do. I became numb since that day and now I am a part of the prostitution market.     Victim 3: I have been into prostitution from around 15 years and these years have been the worst days of my life. If we are not feeling well and we cannot do our job even for a single day, we are thrashed by our mistress for being unproductive even for a day. No matter what we have to complete the daily job hours of us. I even have a daughter but I have sent her to an NGO where they are taking care of her education just because I don't want to put even the shadow of this hell on her and that is why I keep her away from all this. I go to see her at times but secretly, she doesn't know I am her mother. She meets me as a visitor and that's heartbreaking. Nonetheless I don't even know who her father is.     Victim 4:   I am a prostitute from Kolkata and was brought here after I was kidnapped from a market when I was 13 years old. I was really out of control as I knew why they brought me to a place like that. I was screaming and crying because of which the mistress started beating me with a belt. She later gave me shocks with a wire to numb me as one of her customers was waiting. I was still not letting anyone close to me. She then tore of my clothes and dropped honey on my vagina after which she left ant on it. They started biting me and after sometime I actually became numb. She made me take a shower and that's when I got the first man on my body. Later that day I got 12 different men on me. The main was immense but I just forgot how to react.    These are confessions by prostitutes - some of the examples of the pain and agony prostitutes are made to go through. People often use their names or profession as an insult but the realities are really harsh on them which definitely goes unnoticed. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 07 Jul, 12.35 pm

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cricket-epaper-cricket/reports+no+bilateral+cricket+to+be+played+during+ipl+season-newsid-77851940| News Reports : No bilateral cricket to be played during IPL season | It is expected that from 2020, the countries won't play any bilateral series in April and May to allow their players play in the Indian Premier League. The BCCI has suggested this idea in the ICC's two-day meeting in Singapore and quite sure to get the approval at the next meeting as well.ICC's meeting was attended by the chief executives of all the countries on December 7 and 8 where they discussed the Future Tour Programme (FTP) and the Indian cricket board's official also presented a revised FTP in which the BCCI tried to make a structure to ensure that all other member boards will keep their respective cricketers free from any bilateral commitments during the month of April and May, so that they can easily confirm their participation in the IPL. The England and Wales Cricket Board is the only board which still didn't commit to the two-month free window, but the Indian board is hopeful that soon the English board will accept the idea as their home summer starts only in the month of June.  The new window will be started after the 2019 ICC World Cup and this point will be discussed at the BCCI's Special General Body (SGM) meeting in New Delhi on Monday. The introduction of the shortest format of the game had raised many questions over the future of the Test cricket and the 50-over format of the game. But now, people are in love with the shortest format of the game for the fact that it provides a full package of entertainment and through huge IPL revenues, India proved themselves as the biggest game-changer in the world of cricket. "IPL will be the only global marquee event from 2020," sources in the know of developments said as quoted by TOI. In the revised FTP which was presented by the Indian board, it seemed that BCCI tried to restructure India's home season as earlier Indian skipper Virat Kohli raised a question for the packed season this year. The BCCI will not go for any foreign tour between October and November, and February and March, in the next rights cycle from 2019 to 2023. Ahead of the IPL's 11th edition, India is scheduled to tour England and Australia in 2018. The BCCI has proposed that when the time comes to tour these countries in the next rights cycle, the tour will be divided into two parts consisting of Tests on one tour and limited-overs games on the next. England and Australia are already following this policy. In 2021, India will host the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC 50-over World Cup in 2023 and is expected to receive a huge profit as they demanded a hike in hosting fees. "The revised FTP suggests one simple formula. India will not play meaningless cricket anymore with any team. "Each member board is committed to six bilateral arrangements in two years. But the ICC cannot dictate the context in the content," say sources close to developments. An office-bearer, who had the revised FTP and will attend the SGM on Monday, seemed satisfied with the new FTP.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/chennai+individual+plot+owners+can+apply+for+regularisation-newsid-85186300| Tamilnadu Chennai: Individual plot owners can apply for regularisation |  CHENNAI: Giving a respite to the owners of unapproved plot owners in the city, the Greater Chennai Corporation has started accepting applications to regularise unapproved individual plots. The plots would be regularised under the housing department's regularisation of unauthorised layouts and plots scheme. According to a press statement by the civic body, the regularisation applications for unapproved individual plots in sub-division or layouts should be submitted to the Works Department at Ripon Buildings with documents, plans and other details. Although the statement clarified that the applications would only be entertained after registering in the exclusive online portal. The housing department had announced the condoning scheme in October 2017, to regularise unapproved plots and layouts in the state to help the plummeting real estate industry and to obliterate apprehensions of plot owners in the state.    "Plot owners can obtain regularisation of their individual plots lying in the layouts that received in-principle approvals from the CMDA," the Chennai Corporation official said. The civic body also said that the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has been approving in-principle layout framework.  "A total of 21 layout frameworks are approved and further 200 layout frameworks are under process and the in-principle approval for the layout frameworks will be issued soon,"the Chennai Corporation said. The details of the scheme shall be viewed on the website www.tnlayoutreg.in and public can register on the portal, the release said.  The officials also added that the plots would be approved only after the layouts receive in-principle layout framework from CMDA. "To get approval, the plot owners should pay penalty and charges, accordingly. Local body officials will inspect the plots before providing approval certificate," housing department sources said. There would be no levy of OSR charges for the plots registered prior to October 20, 2016, which is the cutoff date for the scheme. The last date for submission of application is May 3, 2018.  'Sub-registrars need not inspect buildings with plan approval'  Property owners may be able to cut down the waiting time to get their documents as the registration department has ordered sub-registrars to stop inspecting buildings with proper planning permissions and issue documents without site inspections. In an official circular issued on Thursday, the Inspector-General of Registration J. Kumaragurubaran said that sub-registrars should derive the values of duties, according to dimensions mentioned in the approved plan. According to department sources, sub-registrars would thus far inspect the buildings to measure the dimensions and to fix duties accordingly. "The new arrangement will cut the delay caused by the site inspection process and the owners will get their registered document sooner. However, the buildings without approved plans will be inspected by the sub-registrars," Kumaragurubaran said. The circular also directs sub-registrars to register the document without building inspection, if the property owners pay maximum stamp duty and registration fee for documents including settlements between family members. According to department sources, some sub-registrars have been inadvertently inspecting the buildings and causing the delay in handing over the registered documents. "The new circular had been issued to clarify the concerned officials about the government orders," a source said. It is to be noted that the departmental government order had been issued in 2010 to give exemption from site inspections to the buildings whose value do not exceed Rs 1 lakh in rural areas and Rs 2 lakh in urban areas.

"Rahul does not want any person other than someone from the Gandhi family run the country. The Congress stands exposed," he tweeted. Referring to Congress press conferences and a Rahul Gandhi-led delegation to the President for a probe into Judge Loya's death, the chief minister said the apex court verdict on the issue has exposed the "ugly face" of the Congress.  Talking to reporters later, he said, "The verdict in Judge Loya case has exposed the Congress once again. Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the people of the country. They have tried to create such an environment that develops negative emotions in the people for the government." The Supreme Court today ruled that Judge Loya died of natural causes and that the petitions were serious attempts to scandalise and obstruct the course of justice. Loya had allegedly died of cardiac arrest in Nagpur on December 1, 2014 when he had gone to attend the wedding of a colleague's daughter. The top court, which was critical of the petitioners and their lawyers for making insinuations against judicial officers and judges, said an attempt was made to cause prejudice against them and it was a "vituperative assault on the judiciary." It said with these petitions it has become clear that "a real attempt and frontal attack" was made on the independence of judiciary and the present case was a manifestation to carry forward a personal agenda. The apex court said frivolous and motivated litigation has been filed to settle political rivalry. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 5.28 pmyesterday3 hrs ago3 days ago3 days ago9 hrs ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/oneindia-epaper-oneindia/chal+mohan+ranga+box+office+collections+a+mediocre+start-newsid-85416170| South Cinema Chal Mohan Ranga Box Office Collections: A Mediocre Start | Summer has started off with a bang in T-Town with expected movies making quite a mark at the box office. After a tsunami called Rangasthalam, an interesting trio combo of Pawan Kalyan, Trivikram Srinivas and Nithiin, have entered the scene with Chal Mohan Ranga, with a cool, breezy and a feel good entertainer.  Word Of Mouth   The word of mouth from the Critics, public and in social media has been average to decent. Chal Mohan Ranga, has been deemed as a one-time watchable flick as the movie runs on a love-breakup-rejoin theme which isn't new to Tollywood audience.  Chal Mohan Ranga Box Office Collections: A Mediocre Start  Powerstar Fans' SupportIt is well-known that Powerstar Pawan Kalyan is one of the producers of the flick along with Trivikram Srinivas and Sudhackar Reddy (Nithiin's father). Fans of Powerstar favor Nithiin as the latter is a self-confessed PK fan. Also to add to the excitement, Pawan Kalyan's reference can be spotted in more than a couple of occasions in the movie.  Chal Mohan Ranga Box Office Collections: A Mediocre Start  Pre-Release StatisticsNizam- 6 Cr, Ceded- 2.7 Cr, Vizag- 1.8 Cr, East- 1.3 Cr, West- 1.1 Cr, Krishna-1.3 Cr, Guntur- 1.4 Cr, Nellore- 0.6 Cr, USA- 2.7 Cr, Karnataka- 0.8 Cr & Rest- 0.3 Cr. The worldwide theatrical value is pegged at a decent 20 Cr which is excluding publicity, prints and other miscellaneous costs. Chal Mohan Ranga, is required to rake in 20 Cr theatrical value in order to attain the 'HIT' mark.   Chal Mohan Ranga Box Office Collections: A Mediocre Start  Day 1 WW CollectionsNizam- 1.1 Cr, Ceded- 0.29 Cr, Vizag- 0.39 Cr, East-0.18 Cr, West- 0.15 Cr, Krishna- 0.22 Cr, Guntur-0.20 Cr, Nellore-0.07 Cr, USA- 0.45 Cr & Rest Estimated- 0.25 Cr. The overall share tally of AP/TS stands at 2.6 Cr whilst the worldwide figure sums up to 3.3 Cr. Worldwide gross figure is an average 6.1 Cr. Much was expected from the magical combo and also for the fact that the theatrical trailer of the flick had created such good negative impact in social media.   Chal Mohan Ranga Box Office Collections: A Mediocre Start  Break-even Mark Chal Mohan Ranga, has opened with a mediocre start at the box office and has raked in just 15% of its total theatrical business. There is still a long way to go for the movie and this summer will be quite a stiff competition at the box office. With Rangasthalam, still going stronger by the day, Natural Star Nani's Krishnarjuna Yuddham and Prince Mahesh Babu's Bharat Ane Nenu, hitting the screens in subsequent weeks, it would indeed be an interestingly poised situation out there. Chal Mohan Ranga has some serious work out there and reaching the 'HIT' mark wouldn't be all that easy for this prestigious 25th flick of the Telangana Abbai.   source: filmibeat.com  Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 10 Apr, 3.32 pm2 weeks ago3 weeks ago3 weeks agoa week ago

However, adding much to their worry overseas recruit Chameera and Jofra Archer has sustained an injury and will be out for few weeks.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/live+mint-epaper-livemint/modicare+faces+challenges+in+reaching+out+to+urban+poor-newsid-85794318| Home Modicare faces challenges in reaching out to urban poor | New Delhi: The government is expecting a challenge in rolling out the National Health Protection Mission (NHPM) to the urban poor after completing the first round of data cleansing earlier this month.Billed as the world's largest health assurance scheme, NHPM, dubbed Modicare, aims to provide free health insurance of Rs5 lakh per family to nearly 40% of the population-more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families based on Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC).The health ministry is currently detecting, correcting and deleting inaccurate records from its database for targeted beneficiaries. While contacting rural beneficiaries to inform them about their entitlement for NHPS has been strategically planned, the major task for the government now is finding the actual whereabouts of urban beneficiaries. "The NHPM is an entitlement-based scheme and the biggest challenge is to reach out to poor and tell them that they are entitled for this scheme," said Dinesh Arora, director, Ayushman Bharat-NHPM. In rural areas, the government has drafted in the rural development ministry and gram panchayats. The gram panchayats will hold Ayushman Diwas on 30 April and read out the list of beneficiaries. In urban areas, however, the government has involved civic authorities. The uneven geographic distribution of poor families may make it difficult for government to find out the real targeted beneficiaries of Modicare. "The NHPM has included people on the criteria of profession. The urban space is geographically diffused and the poor population in urban areas is fluid. The population keeps on coming in, going out and migrating within as well as outside the urban space," said Vinod Kumar Paul, member (health and nutrition), NITI Aayog. Paul is involved in charting out the plans for Modicare."There may come some inherent difficulties in communicating with this chunk of urban population. As this is a national scheme and has to be implemented in partnership with the states, they will have to find out ways to reach out to the lowest quintile of their areas," he said.The different categories in rural area include families having only one room with kutcha walls and kutcha roof; families having no adult member between age 16 to 59; female headed households with no adult male member between age 16 to 59; disabled member and no able bodied adult member in the family; SC/ST households; and landless households deriving major part of their income from manual casual labour. Also, automatically included are families in rural areas having any one of the following attributes-households without shelter; destitute; living on alms; manual scavenger families; primitive tribal groups; and legally released bonded labour. For urban areas, 11 defined occupational categories, including ragpickers, beggars, domestic workers, cobblers, hawkers, construction workers, plumbers, painters and security guards, are entitled under the scheme. "In rural areas, most of the panchayats have updated data but in urban areas, family numbers keep on changing as urban India has mobile and migratory population. We are verifying the data, which is quite challenging in urban areas as there are unauthorized colonies, jhuggi jhopdi clusters that have potential beneficiaries of NHPM," said Alok Saxena, joint secretary, Union health ministry."We are trying to loop in nodal agencies and NGOs so that we can reach targeted beneficiaries. We will send letters to these people. They can also collect their entitlement letters from the post offices," he said.Dailyhunt	|Monday, 16 Apr, 12.06 am7 days agoa week ago2 days ago3 days ago3 weeks ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/new+airport+between+mangaluru+and+udupi+raises+questions+about+feasibility-newsid-68912706| Home New airport between Mangaluru and Udupi raises questions about feasibility | Close on the heels of a proposal to construct a new airport at Padubidri, between Mangaluru and Udupi, questions are raised about its feasibility by the former director of Mangaluru Airport M R Vasudeva Rao. His main objection is that a new airport at Padubidri will make the existing one at Bajpe redundant. The major section of commuters at the Mangaluru airport is from Kasargod. Bajpe to Kasargod is only 65 km, whereas Padubidri is 100 KM. The Kannur airport at Kerala, for which works are already undergoing, is only 92 KM to Kasargod. Hence commuters will prefer to go to Kannur, he says.  Technically the Padubidri airport will not be feasible because Mangaluru airport already has a runway of 2.45 KM. Mere extending of another 550 meters will enable even airbus to land. The land required for it is already with the Airport Authority of India. The extension of 420 meters is very much feasible. The additional land to be acquired for this purpose is merely 90 acres as against the 1000 acres required for the new airport. Regarding the doubt expressed about constructing a runway on the hillock, Vasudev Rao asks "who said it is not possible? Has a survey been made?" he asks. Constructing a new airport costs huge funds, to the tune of Rs 5000 crores to Rs 10,000 crores and land of 1000 acres, whereas extending the Mangaluru Bajpe airport costs only Rs 1120 crores and acquiring 90 acres of land. Shifting of infrastructure like radar etc will once again cost additional. In 1988-89 when extension of Mangaluru airport was planned, 6000 ft land at Nandikur, Padubidri for construction of runway was available. At Bengre 8000 ft for runway was also available. The reason Bajpe was chosen was that both Padubidri and Bengre were found not suitable. It took 14 years to acquire the land for Mangaluru airport. Now, how long it will take to acquire 1000 acres of land for proposed new airport is anybody guess, he said. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 13 Jun, 6.27 pm
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/curejoy-epaper-curejoy/top+3+exercises+for+squint+eyes+strabismus+you+must+try-newsid-68335699| Cure Top 3 Exercises For Squint Eyes (Strabismus) You Must Try | Squint eyes, or strabismus, is a vision disorder. Both eyes don't work as a team, failing to look in the same direction. One eye can look straight ahead, but the other looks up, down, in, or out. It can happen at any age, but it's most common in kids.1  Causes People can be born with squint eyes from an unknown cause. The condition is sometimes hereditary, so it could even run in the families. Other times, squint eye develops in children from short-sightedness, long-sightedness, and astigmatism. The eyes try to overcome these vision issues, but end up losing muscle control. 2 Stroke, Down syndrome, and injuries to the eye and brain can cause squint in adults. It may also develop from childhood eye problems that were never treated.3  3 Exercises To Fix Squint Eyes 1. Pencil Push-Ups    Pencil push-ups are easy workouts that treat convergence insufficiency. This condition means that the eyes can't converge - or move toward each other - to focus on the same thing. Aside from squint eyes, it can also cause headaches, blurry vision, and eye strain. To do a pencil push-up, all you need is a pencil. Hold it at arm's length in between your eyes. Move the pencil toward your nose, but try to keep looking at it. Focus on seeing the pencil as a single image. Once you see double, move the pencil away. Studies have shown that two sets of 20 push-ups daily have awesome benefits. If this seems too much, do one set of 10 pencil push-ups each day.4  2. Brock String Workout    A tool called a Brock string can boost eye coordination. It costs about 10 dollars, but you can make one. A Brock string is usually a 10-foot cord with 3 or 5 wooden beads of different colors. To use a Brock string, tie one end to a stationary object like a chair. Move the beads into equal intervals and hold the string up to your nose, pulling it taut. Focus on the bead that's closest to your face. You should start seeing two strings that cross at the bead, creating an X. Aim to see an X at all the beads, except the farthest one. Here, the strings will look like a V. This form of vision therapy can be done daily. Exercises to fix squint eyes for children can also include the Brock string since it's like a game. The aspect of color recognition will add a fun twist. 3. Barrel Cards    Using a Barrel card is another easy way to improve convergence. Making one is simple. Draw three circles across an index card, each one a little bigger than the last. Repeat on the other side, in the same order - but in green. To do this exercise, hold it up to your nose in a horizontal position. The smallest circles should be closest to you. Focus on both of the larger circles until you see a single red-green circle. Hold for five seconds. Repeat with the middle circle, and again with the smallest one. Do this workout once a day. While Barrel cards are good exercises to fix squint eyes for adults, children can also benefit. You can even make several cards with different shapes and colors. Safety Measures Check with your doctor before doing these exercises. He might have you do them in his office first. This way, he can give you feedback and make sure you know how to do them right. Do these exercises in a quiet room, free of distractions (this include pets, kids, and other people in your home). It will let you focus on the workouts - literally! Other Ways to Fix Squint Eyes  Patch: Wearing a patch over the better eye can force the weaker one to work harder. Eventually, its muscle and vision will get stronger. Be sure to wear the patch for as long as you're told. Glasses: Both children and adults can benefit from glasses. Again, use them as directed. Eye Muscle Surgery: Eye muscles can be strengthened by shortening them. The outcome is great, and you can typically go home that same day. It's mostly done in children but adults can get it as well.5   Early detection is key for proper treatment. Both kids and adults should regularly visit the eye doctor, even if they don't wear glasses. It's the best way to help both eyes stay in good shape.  Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 31 May, 4.47 am

Yeddyurappa will become Chief Minister again after the state assembly polls. Mr Reddy had played a pivotal role in ensuring the party's victory in 2008 but later, the party distanced itself from him after the mining baron got embroiled in a series of illegal mining cases and was arrested. After meeting the Siddaganga Math seer here, Mr Reddy told reporters that he visited the math to seek the blessings of Sri Shiva kumara Swamiji. He asserted that that Lingayat strongman B.S. Yeddyurappa will become Chief Minister after the assembly elections.    "The BJP is in my blood, I will work to see Yeddyurappa become CM after this elections", he said. It may be recalled that Mr Reddy along with 40-odd BJP MLAs had rebelled against Mr Yeddyurappa in 2009 in an attempt to dethrone him from the CM post . However, both entered into a truce after the intervention of party senior leader Ms Sushma Swaraj. The former minister also said that despite the rebellion by sitting BJP MLA in Molakalmuru, Thippeswamy, his close friend and Ballari MP B. Sriramulu, the BJP candidate for the constituency, will emerge victorious. He, however, refused to comment on the statement of Party National President Mr Amit Shah that the BJP has nothing to do with Mr Reddy.  BJP's final list delayed as party scouts for Winnable candidates  While some in the BJP believe state party chief, B.S. Yeddyurappa, is playing a big role in selection of candidates for the party's final list for the coming assembly poll, others claim that winna bility is the only criterion being followed and this is why the party has been slow in releasing it. "The final list is the one that takes much longer to finalise as the party is scouting for candidates who can win and help it get a simple majority of 113 seats," said a senior leader. The BJP ,which has so far not announ ced candidates for many south Karna taka and Bengaluru city constituencies, has, surprisingly, not announced candidates for a few seats in coastal Karnata- ka as well although it is considered its stronghold. While some claim that old loyalists are being ignored and tickets are being given to those who deserted the party along with Mr Yeddyurappa and returned with him, others dismiss the theory. "It is not a question of loyalists or non-loyalists getting tickets. We have to win and so the party is trying to field the right candidates. In Tumakuru, loyalist S. Shivanna came fourth in the last assembly elections and so Jyothi Prasad, who was a KJP candidate, but performed well, got the party ticket," said a party insider, explaining that so far Mr Yeddyurappa has been given the freedom to choose candidates for nearly 30 per cent of the seats announced considering his experience, tour of the state and feedback from district workers. Another 30 per cent of candidates were backed by top senior leaders like Ananth Kumar and D.V. Sadanada Gowda. And around 15 to 20 per cent by different frontal organisations. "All these were accommodated in the first and the second lists. Now in the last leg, we need to field candidates, who can help us get a clear lead over our rivals," said the leader.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/these+16+stars+disclosed+unbelievable+secrets+about+their+sexual+lives-newsid-73873880| Celebrities These 16 Stars Disclosed Unbelievable Secrets About Their Sexual Lives |  Their bold confessions will leave you utterly shocked!  What do you think is the difference between the traditional Bollywood stars and the young ones?  The one that I noticed is that earlier, Bollywood celebs were supposed to keep their personal lives a secret. But now an overflow of stars can be seen slowly opening up a lot more to the world. Right from Alia Bhatt to Deepika Padukone and from Ranveer Singh to Anurag Kashyap, everyone has confessed about the things which are called to be taboo in Indian society. They revealed their extramarital affairs, one-night stands and even their sex position or other feelings on the same.  They have broken the hard shells and stereotype mentality of their fans by sharing these secrets. So, let's start with the young Alia Bhatt who shared her most personal desire related to sex. These confessions will give you quite a shock that you would be rooted to the spot. Alia Bhatt, the star of the films, Udta Punjab, Dear Zindagi and Kapoor And Sons never revealed her relationship status with co-star Sidharth Malhotra in public. But it was rumoured that the couple had parted ways. In an interview with a famous magazine, Alia said, "If a relationship has ended, it is obviously for a reason. If it was not supposed to end, then he will come back. I always believe that if a person is meant for you, he will return to you."   When she was asked about her favourite sex position, this is what she replied...   Alia showed her naughty side and revealed to Mid-Day that her favourite sex position is 'the classic missionary' because she is 'a simple person'. When asked what she would first check if he left his phone unlocked, she said that she should know the password to her boyfriend's phone.  Sonam Kapoor is known for her blunt replies and straightforward beliefs. But according to Deccan Chronicle, on a chat show, she showed some concern about her brother and said, "He has terrible taste in women. I never say this to him directly. He has decided he does not want to date girls who are like Rhea and me."   The Ranjhanaa actress along with sister Rhea Kapoor had sent messages to Harsh expressing their concern about him using protection. She said, "She's sweet but tacky; Not bad, but you can do better; We hope you're using protection; Why do you have such bad taste in women?"   Ranveer Singh never hesitates to share his sexual experiences with his fans. Once in an interview, he claimed that he was 12 when he lost his virginity. He said, "I think I was around 12 when I did it. I started everything early, everything! I was way ahead - so much so that in school all the mothers used to say he (Ranveer) is that rotten apple that's spoiling all our kids. I used to hold sermons with all the boys surrounding me, and I used to teach them."   According to India Today, Ranveer Singh, who is the first A-list Bollywood actor to endorse a condom brand, says he always carries a condom in his wallet.  Ranbir is already being called the face of Bollywood's next generation. Talking about his past life, Ranbir said, "There was marijuana, there was alcohol, I started smoking cigarettes."    "I must have been around 15 years old when I lost my virginity," said Ranbir Kapoor in an interview with a well-known magazine.  According to the sources, Salman Khan has dated actress Katrina Kaif, but after years of speculation, Kaif admitted in an interview in 2011 that she had been in a serious relationship with Salman Khan for several years, but it ended in 2010. Sangeeta Bijlani and Somy Ali were also in serious relationships with Khan.   "I am a virgin," he said in the popular show Koffee With Karan in 2013. He also shocked his fans by his statement, "I am going to save myself for the one that I get married to." According to Deccan Chronicle, in 2016, on the same show, "You're still a virgin?" Karan asked. "Yes, nothing's changed. Still a virgin and so are you, Karan," came Salman's reply.  Arjun Kapoor who believes love is happiness, friendship and compatibility, if you are truly happy it must be love.   But in an interview about what is more important food or sex, he said...   According to Filmfare, when Arjun was asked about the ugly truth about men, he replied, "That they rate sex over love. Sex is more important than love for men."   Twinkle Khanna is known as Miss Funnybone of the Industry. Twinkle and Akshay have been married for 16 years and have two children, son Aarav and daughter Nitara. About their marriage, Twinkle said, "I think it's a great team. We are playing tennis doubles, and I think that's a pretty good foundation for a marriage to last."   When asked about sex, she replied...   According to the sources, on the importance of sex in a marriage, she said, "Sex is important at every stage." Twinkle even added a witty comment that, "The things that I find attractive in Akshay have changed over the years."   The film and television actor Sushant Singh Rajput started his career with television serials and now he is one of the most desired and talented faces of Bollywood. There have been rumors about him being in a relationship with Ankita Lokhande and Kriti Senon. But what is more shocking is his reply to the question, "What is your favourite sex position?"   According to Dainik Bhaskar, Sushant Singh Rajput, in an interview, made a confession when he was asked about his favourite sex position. The actor was pretty straightforward to reveal that it was 69. "I like things in 60, so it has to be 69," Sushant claimed.  After ages of being in the 'neither admitting nor denying' phase, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have finally moved forward and accepted their relationship status in public. You have already read what Ranveer has to say about his ideas about sex, now let's see what Deepika feels about it.  During an interview, she spoke about emotional attachment while having sex. She said, "For me, sex is not about getting physical; there are emotions involved."   Gorgeous and stunning Nargis Fakhri, despite being a newcomer (who could barely speak Hindi) has made it into Bollywood and even survived in the industry for a long time has some different views about relationships.   According to her...   According to Dainik Bhaskar's report, Nargis claimed, "Sex is so important that if you aren't getting enough of it, get out of the relationship."   Emraan Hashmi is known for making the most honest confessions. It takes a person who is confident in his own skin to own up to something like that. Emraan is an immensely talented actor and has given us some real-powerful roles.    "As a married man, I miss one night stands," says Emraan Hashmi, whose sex scenes are the USP of his movies.  The Ooh La La girl, Vidya Balan On 14 December 2012, got married to Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures in a private ceremony. She spilt a secret about women that will absolutely shock you.   According to sources, when Karan Johar asked Vidya about that one secret about women that men don't know, she said, "We like it, need it and want it as much as they (men) do!"   The couple Kashmira Shah and Krushna Abhishek become parents to twin boys through surrogacy earlier this year in June. The new mommy who is known for her blunt statements disclosed her favourite sex position in an interview that will leave you stunned.   According to sources, Kashmira shared about her favourite sex situation. She said, "My favourite sex position is 'Doggy Style'"   Kalki Koechlin revealed that she had been sexually abused when she was just 9 years old. "I felt it was my mistake and so I kept it hidden for years," she said.   According to India Times, during a conversation, Kalki disclosed how she was once a victim of sexual abuse. She said, "I allowed someone to have sex with me at the age of nine, not understanding fully what it meant."   Govinda is one of those celebrities who confessed about their private life secrets to the media. But he still believes that some things are better hidden from the public.   "I have had extramarital affairs," he said, but he didn't go on to reveal the exact facts.  Anurag Kashyap, Indian film director, writer, producer and actor disclosed one of his nightmares according to a report by India Times. He thanked his ex-wife Kalki Koechlin for helping him completely cure the acrimony.   He revealed that...    "I met the man who molested me as I was a child," he said. Sharing the torture, he added, "I met him after many years. He wasn't some dirty old man. He was 22 when he abused me. He was guilt-ridden when we met. I decided to put the whole nightmare behind me and move on."  Kudos to these brave stars who have the guts to step out and reveal to the world their darkest secrets and share the most difficult moments of their lives. I hope you liked the story.

Previously, the board's role in the Class XI examination was just to provide the question papers while the invigilators were from the respective schools. But from next session onwards, the JKBOSE will designate its staff as superintendents/deputy superintendents at all examination centres across the state.  Roshan Lal Gupta, Joint Secretary of Examination, JKBOSE said: "Yes, we are doing away with the home examination system for Class XI. The exams will now be conducted by the JKBOSE under its overall supervision. In fact, the marking in the papers, which was earlier done by the respective schools, is now the responsibility of the school board."   "The upcoming Class XI annual examination of the winter zone, Kashmir division to be held in October-November this year will be conducted by the JKBOSE. Similarly, the Class XI annual examination for the summer zone, Jammu Province to be held in March-April next year will be conducted by the school board," he added. When asked about the ongoing Class XI examination, Gupta said: "The ongoing examination will continue as per the past Term 1 and Term 2 pattern. The exams will resume on April 26. However, there is likely to be one annual examination under the JKBOSE from the next academic session."  Sources claimed that the reason behind this move was the alleged Class XI Physical Education paper leak, which had raised some serious questions over the conduct of examination by the schools on their respective premises, especially in private ones.  Meanwhile, the school board had decided to lodge an FIR with the Crime Branch, Jammu, against the erring institutions for opening the sealed packets ahead of the schedule of the conduct of Physical Education paper is in the process of getting details about the 5-7 defaulting private schools.

It is based in Jammu & Srinagar and is an autonomous body under the administration of the state government of Jammu and Kashmir.

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm2 weeks ago7 days ago7 days ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/curejoy-epaper-curejoy/5+reasons+why+it+is+important+to+wear+clean+underwear-newsid-76440933| Wellness 5 Reasons Why It Is Important To Wear Clean Underwear | Wear clean underwear. Isn't it something you were taught in childhood? Then why start unlearning the good things? Wearing clean, fresh, and washed underwear is something you need to do every day, just like the way you brush your teeth every morning, irrespective of how busy you are. There is no valid reason why you wouldn't do this on a daily basis. No, bathing doesn't make it any better! Bathing and wearing the same underwear is just as bad and wearing it inside out doesn't change anything either. Here are 5 reasons why you must ensure that you wear clean and washed underwear every day.  1. To Maintain Basic Hygiene    Practicing good hygiene should be an essential part of your life as it is important for good health. Taking a bath, brushing your teeth, and wearing washed clothes every day are all a part of your basic hygiene. Wearing clean underwear is primarily for your personal hygiene. Fresh underwear is free from microbes and bacteria that can have adverse effects on your health. 2. To Prevent Infections    Underwears help to absorb sweat, but not changing it on a daily basis can increase the risk of yeast infection as yeast and bacteria thrive in a moist environment. A dirty pair of underwear may have traces of feces on it. The bacteria from the fecal matter can spread to your urinary tract, resulting in a urinary tract infection. To prevent infections, you need to ensure that you wear clean, dry underwear each day. 3. To Prevent Rashes    Your skin may turn itchy if you have been sitting in the same underwear and clothes for a day or two. What starts with just an itch can soon turn into a rash or sore. Although these rashes can be treated easily, it is always better to prevent them by wearing fresh and bacteria-free underwear. If you notice a rash, clean the area and ensure that you start changing your underwear regularly. If it still doesn't heal, visit your doctor at the earliest. 4. To Keep You Comfortable    How do you feel when you have a shower and put on clean clothes? It is certainly better than the way you felt before you cleaned yourself. The dirt, sweat, and bacteria can make you extremely uncomfortable. Additionally, it can have a negative impact on your sexual life. Not only will the stains and itch make you and them uncomfortable, the other person is also put at the risk of an infection due to your negligence. 5. To Maintain High Self-Confidence    You must have noticed a strange odor from down there. This is a sign for you to change. Although the vagina cleans itself, the other parts remain dirty and need to be kept clean. This unpleasant smell and infection caused due to dirty underwear can affect your self-confidence as you may hesitate to have a social interaction. The fear of other people smelling the foul odor can keep you from talking to them.  It is always better to stick to cotton underwear instead of silk or nylon ones. Cotton underwears let your skin breathe and prevent infections. Wearing tight underwear can lead to an infection as the moisture is trapped. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 16 Nov, 6.46 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/oneindia-epaper-oneindia/how+can+you+reduce+capital+gains+tax+on+residential+property-newsid-85957810?s=dw&ss=twt| Market Update How Can You Reduce Capital Gains Tax On Residential Property? | In India, whenever you sell a residential property and earn capital gains on it, you have to pay tax on the profit. Let's see how this works: For instance, if you purchased a property in 2013 for Rs 20 lakhs but sold it in 2017 for Rs 40 lakhs. You have to pay capital gains tax on the Rs 20 lakhs profit earned. What Is Capital Gains Tax On Residential Property? Capital gains tax on residential property is a tax amount you have to pay when you sell a property like an apartment owned by you. This taxed is calculated on the amount of profit acquired by selling a property.  The profit is the amount difference between the initial purchased value minus the value at which property is sold.   There are two types of capital gains tax:  • Long term capital gains tax: You are liable to pay long term capital gains if you sell the purchased residential property after 3 years and 20% capital gains tax is applied after indexation.  • Short term capital gains tax: You are liable to pay short term capital gains if you sell the purchased residential property within 3 years of the original purchase date. The government still provides you the advantage of indexation because if the property rates have increased, inflation has also increased. So, indexation is used to exactly calculate capital gains tax.  How Can You Save Capital Gains Tax On Residential Property?  As already discussed, you are liable to pay either long term capital gains tax or short term capital gains tax. Here are some ways to save tax on residential property.   1) Reinvest in another residential property  When you sell a residential property, you can save capital gains tax by reinvesting the whole profit amount in another residential property. For this, if you have purchased a property in the time frame of previous 1 year, which is calculated from the transfer date of the property being sold, then you can get exemption under section 54. Additionally, under this section, if you have not already purchased a residential property in the previous year, you can reinvest the profit amount in next 2 year in any residential property of India. This 2-year period is calculated from the date of transfer of the property being sold.   2) Construction of another residential property  Under the same section 54, if you initiate the construction of property within next 3 years, you can get tax exemption. This 3-year period is calculated from the date of transfer of the property being sold. Also, both the clauses, construction and reinvestment, of section 54 is applicable to only single Indian residential property.   3) Invest in NHAI or REC bonds  There are various bond schemes issued by Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) which can help you in tax exemption. When you are not willing to invest in another property or you have exhausted that option, REC and NHAI bonds are a great option. However, you can only invest in first 6 months calculated from the date of transfer of the property, and the invested amount can reach to Rs 50,00,000. Additionally, from the date of transfer of the property till 3-year completion, you can't sell these bonds.   4) Invest in capital gains account   You may come across a situation where you can't purchase or construct a new residential property before the last date of return filing. In such a scenario, you can deposit the amount to be invested in capital gains account. Usually, most public banks provide the facility of capital gains account. However, you should note that this amount would be tax exempt only if it is utilized for property construction or purchase within 3 years. After the completion of 3 years calculated from the date of the property transfer, this amount will be liable to tax from that year.   Best Way to Reduce Capital Gains Tax on Residential Property  The first move before taking any measure is to calculate the capital gains tax you are liable to pay. If the tax amount is too much, then look for options to save it.  Investing the acquired money in capital gains bond is not an appealing option because these bonds offer low interest rates, generally, 6 per cent per year. Hence, if you still have an option of buying a new property or constructing one, we suggest you to take that option.   What Can Do in Case of Loss in a Residential Property?  Many a times property rates go down and you have to suffer a loss. In such a situation, your long term capital loss after the property is sold can be cancelled with the long term capital gain that you acquired when you sold any capital asset excluding shares, mutual bonds, etc.  When you can't set off full long term capital loss in one financial year, then you can set off the remaining portion for next 8 years. But, only the same head can set off this amount.   When Every Option Is Ruled Out  If you deal in property a lot, then you may come across a situation where you have exhausted all these options. We suggest you to pay the capital gains tax according to laws and guidelines of India. Involving in complicated procedures for saving some tax is not a good option, and staying compliant with the law is always preferable. If you are still worried about the capital gains tax, then talk to your CA (Chartered Accountant) or any tax expert for exact tax exemption method in case of high capital gains tax.  Conclusion   It is important to evaluate your options beforehand. Carefully, calculate the amount of capital gains tax that you have to pay and then select the most feasible option. If you have already bought a property in past one year, that is the most practical approach for saving your capital gains tax. Otherwise, always keep property construction or purchase as your first option. It is important that you make the best use of the exemptions provided, so that you reduce your tax liability.  source: goodreturns.in  Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 18 Apr, 10.22 am2 months ago7 days ago3 weeks agoa month ago3 months ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/kerala+doctor+s+open+letter+to+fellow+indians+goes+viral+even+celebs+are+sharing+it-newsid-68324623| Home Kerala doctor's open letter to fellow Indians goes viral, even celebs are sharing it | A Facebook post on communal violence by Dr Nelson Joseph, who practices at Lakeshore Hospital in Kochi, has gone viral and is now being discussed and debated widely by netizens across the country. In his write-up titled 'An open letter to all Indians from Kerala', Nelson discusses an incident where a temple in Malappuram was vandalised and points out how certain powerful 'leaders' use lies and deceit to create differences between people of varied backgrounds and religions. The original letter in Malayalam had over 2300 reactions and was shared over 1700 times on Facebook, while the English version saw 1900 reactions and 1400 shares. Several politicians, celebrities and activists such as filmmaker Aashiq Abu, have promoted the post. The English version of the letter also found tremendous popularity on Twitter and Reddit, stirring strong debates. Let's first take a look at the incident in question. On Saturday, a temple in a village near Nilambur in Malappuram district was found desecrated and the idols vandalised. The incident was almost immediately followed by a hartal led a couple of Hindutva groups. Then commenced a campaign, both direct and through social media, urging Hindus in Kerala to be ready to open refugee camps across the southern districts of the state. There were also rumours of an even bigger 'an attack on Hindus' and possible Muslim involvement. This resulted in the escalation of the religious tension in the area and, to a lesser extent, across the state.  Mohanakumar SS. Photo courtesy: Twitter  However, the incident didn't boil over to anything untoward, thanks to the Kerala police. Within 24 hours the local cops arrested Mohanakumar SS, a Thiruvananthapuram native, in connection with the temple desecration case and booked him under IPC Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion) among other sections. Though Mohanakumar confessed to the crime, when asked about the motive he would only say that he did it to protest against the bad customs in the Hinduism. The police said he is a goon for hire and is an accused in a murder that happened 11 years ago. Nelson's letter raises a few important questions regarding the incidents. Mohanakumar travelled more than 350 kms just to protest against bad customs. And just by co-incidence he chose a temple in the district with the largest Muslim population in the state. Also, the incident happened the very next day after the cattle slaughter ban order was announced and on the first day of Ramadan and the day of the beef fests. Too much of a co-incidence, don't you think?  The doctor also points out that prior to the 2002 Gujarat riots, a prominent local newspaper had reported an incident that the bodies of two Hindu women were found on the banks of a river. It was proved to be a fabricated story days later but the damage was already done. Nelson concludes the letter by warning his fellow Indians that these incidents will keep on happening. He also lists out three things we should all take into consideration at testing times. Do not jump to conclusions. If someone says that "Hindus are not allowed to venture out to the Attingal sea", first ask is it true or at least ask does Attingal have a sea or a beach or at least a lagoon. If someone poses as your savior or of your religion, first think who will have the ultimate gain. You or him? If a leader tells you to go and kill someone for Hindutva/ Christianity/ Islam, first think is it for him or for the betterment of "said religion". We are educated for a reason. Ask for the source of facts and figures. Try to understand the truth. The doctor signs off with the words "No one - neither some leader at Delhi or Lok Sabha or somewhere else - can replace your immediate neighbour in the time of need."

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/newsbytes-epaper-newbyt/5+5+billion+mobile+users+by+2022+india+to+lead-newsid-70512195| Latest 5.5 billion mobile users by 2022, India to lead |  5.5 billion mobile users by 2022, India to lead  19 Jul 2017 While global mobile penetration is on the rise, Asia-Pacific has become the biggest contributor to the growth in the global numbers. American research firm Forrester predicted over 5.5 billion or 70% of the world's population would have a mobile by 2022, a rise of nearly 100% from 2008. The jump would especially be due to the increasing mobile adoption in India and China.  Android to have the largest market share by 2017  Global Market Forrester said the number of global smartphone users is expected to hit 3.8 billion by 2022. The number would cross "the 50% mark for smartphone penetration by population in 2017, and reaching 66% by 2022." About 94% of the smartphone users currently have Android or iOS. By 2017-end, Android would have 73% of the market share while Apple would capture 21% and Windows 4%.  Number of mobile subscribers in India  Fact According to the data recently released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the number of mobile phone users has crossed the one billion subscribers' mark. Except for Bihar (54%) and Assam (56%), all Indian states have more than 60% mobile penetration. Smartphones to account for 97% mobile data traffic by 2022  India India currently has more than 300 million smartphone users thanks to the fast smartphone adoption. While GSM technology dominated the mobile subscriptions in 2016, LTE and WCDMA/HSPA are forecast to account for 85% of the subscriptions by 2022. The 5G technology, expected to be deployed in 2022, is predicted to represent around 0.2% of the subscriptions by the year 2022.  Smartphone and tablet users  Fact According to Forrester: "Large-screen smartphones are contributing to the decline in tablet users: In metro China and India, 65% and 62% of online adult smartphone users, respectively, have a screen size between 5.0 and 6.0 inch." Consumer adoption to decline while business adoption predicted to increase  Tablets Globally, the number of tablet purchases would decline over the next five years. The total tablet user base would decrease at 1.1% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) by 2022, plummeting to 579 million in 2022 compared to 2016's 615 million. While the number of consumer-owned tablets would come down at 3.3% CAGR by 2022, that of business-owned tablets would grow at 6.9% CAGR.  Dramatic shift to high-speed mobile technologies  Asia-Pacific Region Another recent report highlighted how Asia-Pacific's mobile industry would contribute to the growth of the region's economy and social development by 2020. The region has been witnessing a dramatic shift to high-speed mobile networks, thanks to the 3G and 4G technologies. Also, Asian mobile operators are set to be among the first ones in the world to commercially launch 5G networks before 2020. Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 19 Jul, 12.10 pm

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/investment+guru+india-epaper-invgur/top+5+scooters+at+auto+expo+2018+honda+activa+5g+tvs+ntorq+and+more-newsid-81673106| TOP STORIES Top 5 Scooters At Auto Expo 2018: Honda Activa 5G, TVS NTORQ And More... | The Auto Expo 2018 was packed with new launches, unveils and interesting showcases, of which, the majority was comprised of scooters. Before you hit the Expo this weekend, we bring you a list of the top five scooters at the Auto Expo 2018.  Aprilia Storm 125  The Aprilia SR 150 is certainly one of the sportiest scooters in India today, but it is also priced towards the premium end of the spectrum at Rs 70,939 (ex-showroom, Pune). In order to grab hold of a larger audience, Aprilia launched the SR 125 at Rs 65,310 (ex-showroom, Pune) and unveiled the Storm 125 . In terms of styling, both the scooters looks similar to the Aprilia SR 150.  But the key difference between the Storm 125 from the SR 125 is the wheel size. The Storm 125 sports 12-inch wheels instead of the 14-inch ones seen on the SR range. That said, these are the fattest tyres seen on a scooter, with the front being a 120/80 section rubber, while the rear gets a 130/80 section tyre. Other difference includes bright colours and funky new graphics. It will also come with different optional accessories such as a large windscreen.  Powering this scooter is a 124.49cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine sourced from the Vespa VXL/SXL 125. Mated to a CVT transmission, the Storm 125 delivers 9.65PS of power at 7,250rpm and 9.9Nm of torque at 6,250rpm. Suspension duties are carried out by telescopic front forks and an adjustable rear monoshock. As is the case with SR branded scooters, the Storm also gets a disc brake up front, with a drum brake at the rear. Once launched, we expect the Storm 125 to be priced at approximately Rs 67,000 (ex-showroom).  Honda Activa 5G  Honda unveiled a total of 11 models at the Auto Expo 2018, one of which was the new generation Activa 5G. The scooter has received a few subtle updates for the new year. Honda also introduced an additional variant of the scooter, known as the 'Deluxe' variant wherein, along with the standard features you also get a semi-digital instrument console which shows ECO options and service due indicator. The standard features include an all-LED headlamp - a feature that was first introduced by the Honda Grazia in the segment -, chrome inserts on the front apron and two new colour options - Metallic Yellow and Red. Other than that, the scooter remains unchanged.  It is still powered by the old 109cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine, which produces 8PS of power at 7,500rpm and 9Nm of torque at 5,500rpm. With the few modern touches, the Activa 5G certainly adds a dash of freshness over the Activa 4G that it replaces. Prices aren't announced yet, but we expect the new model to be available at a price hike of around Rs 1500 over the Activa 4G that costs Rs 51,460 (ex-showroom, Delhi).   Suzuki Burgman Street  Suzuki also made its presence felt at the Auto Expo 2018 by unveiling the Suzuki Burgman Street. In terms of design, it sports a maxi-scooter inspired look with its large windscreen and split LED headlamp placed within the front apron, on top of the mudguard. The fully-digital instrument console sits right in between the handlebar and the windscreen. There is a multi-function key slot, generous underseat storage and a 12V charging socket as well. The rider seat section is slightly tapered down, whereas the pillion seat looks broad. At the rear, it sports a single-piece grab rail and a single-piece cluster consisting of an LEDtaillight and side indicators. It packs the same engine that is seen on the Suzuki Access 125. This 124cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder unit produces 8.7PS of power at 7,000rpm and a peak torque of 10.2Nm at 5,000rpm. With the Burgman range available internationally, Suzuki has always focused on comfort. So expect the Burgman Street to offer the same in India. To the same effect, the Burgman Street features telescopic forks up front and a monoshock at the back. The 90/90-12 front tyre gets a disc brake, while the 90/100-10 rear wheel is bolted with a drum brake. Suzuki is expected to launch the Burgman Street soon. Expect it to be approximately Rs 7,000 costlier than the Suzuki Access 125.  2018 Aprilia SR 150  The Aprilia SR 150 has been updated for 2018. These updates include new livery for the 'Race' variant, new colours including a Carbon Se edition for the standard model and a semi-digital instrument console. Other than these changes, the scooter remains unchanged mechanically and cosmetically. It packs the same 154.8cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine, which delivers 10.5PS of power and 11.4Nm of torque. The 2018 model will most likely replace the ongoing SR 150 and will be priced the same at Rs 70,939 (ex-showroom, Pune).  TVS Ntorq 125  Just a day before the Auto Expo 2018, TVS launched its first ever 125cc scooter - the NTorq 125 - at a price of Rs 58,750 (ex-showroom Delhi). The scooter is edgy and has been designed to look sporty to attract many young buyers. It certainly has taken a lot of inspiration from the Graphite concept that was showcased at the Auto Expo 2016. The NTorq 125 is also the first Indian scooter to get Bluetooth connectivity. Its fully digital instrument console hosts a total of 55 features including navigation assist, a lap timer, engine oil temperature, top speed recorder, last park location assist and a service reminder to name a few. Powering the scooter is an all-new 124.79cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder motor. It churns out 9.4PS of power at 7,500rpm and 10.5Nm of torque at 5,500rpm. Suspension duties here are handled by telescopic forks up front, while the rear houses twin gas-charged shock absorbers. Braking is done via a front 220mm disc and a rear 130mm drum brake. At Rs 58,750, the TVS NTORQ 125 scooter comes across a great value for money option since the Honda Grazia, its closest rival, is priced at Rs 58,155.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+wire+english-epaper-wireng/188+sign+letter+to+maneka+against+replacing+cooked+food+with+nutrient+packets-newsid-86027560| Science 188 Sign Letter To Maneka Against Replacing Cooked Food With 'Nutrient Packets' |  Every few months, news from the Women and Child Development Ministry gives an indication that the minister, Maneka Gandhi, is interested in overhauling India's nutrition scheme for children and women. Her stand is at odds with her own ministry, with orders of the Supreme Court and with legislation. Yet she has continued to push for the replacement of fresh, hot, cooked food with 'nutrient packets' in India's Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).  The Hindu reported last week that once again, Gandhi has asked for her ministry to consider 'energy-dense, factory-made' nutrient packets as take-home ration to beneficiary families, instead of sourcing fresh and cooked food from women's self-help groups, which is the status quo.  Some 188 academics, activists and people working in the area of health and nutrition for children and women have written to her with their concerns over her continued push towards processed food. Their letter reads, For years, the Right to Food Campaign has been fighting the battle against the role of private contractors in the supply of supplementary nutrition in the ICDS. In state after state it has been seen that the unholy nexus between the contractors and politicians/bureaucrats result in central contracts worth hundreds of crores for supply of food to ICDS. The quality of food supplied to the centres is compromised while companies make profits from the meagre allocation on supplementary nutrition. Recent scams related to the above have been brought to light in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The letter has been signed by people at many well-known organisations, such as the Right to Food Campaign, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, the Public Health Resource Network, Sahaj, Sahayog, Saheli, the All India Democratic Women's Association, Haq, the Centre for Equity Studies, Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest, Greenpeace, National Law School of India University, Ambedkar University and the Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation. India's ICDS programme discharges two important functions simultaneously: It provides food to infants (children under the age of six) and women who are pregnant or lactating. On the Global Hunger Index, India was placed at a shameful 100 out of 119 countries last year. The right to food in India has been upheld by the Supreme Court in various orders, drawing from a public interest litigation filed in 2001 by the People's Union for Civil Liberties. The Supreme Court appointed a monitoring group to ensure that their directions are indeed implemented. The court has also passed very specific directions over the years, including one that banned private contractors from taking control of the ICDS supply chain. Now, Gandhi's proposal would bring private contractors into the ICDS. In 2013, the Indian parliament enacted the National Food Security Act. The new letter addressed to Gandhi reminds her of the existing legal framework on the issue: 'We request you not to give in to the interest of profit and continue to abide by the letter and spirit of the National Food Security Act in providing locally made take home rations to children in the anganwadi centres.'  The Wire had reported in September 2017, that Maneka Gandhi, NITI Aayog and her ministry were all at odds with each other on this issue. At that time as well, Gandhi had been recommending nutrient packets to her ministry. NITI Aayog was recommending cash transfers and an associated pilot project. But the Women and Child Development Ministry itself had been publicly discussing its achievements in providing fresh cooked food. The ministry has also filed affidavits in various courts saying that they will continue to uphold the provision of fresh cooked food.  @Narendramodi_PM @Manekagandhibjp @MinistryWCD @NITIAayog Is the WCD contemplation of involving manufacturers against the aspiration of the Department and Supreme Court's directions? and Is packaged food prepared months ago more nutritious? pic.twitter.com/DPRKBGBZQg  — Dipika Sahani (@dipika_sahani) April 17, 2018  Shortly after, The Wire also reported that the government had again clarified that the latter was not doing away with fresh cooked food. Then, in October 2017, the women and child development ministry issued a press release reiterating that it was not doing away with cooked food. There is no proposal to discontinue Supplementary Nutrition Program under ICDS and replace it with Conditional Cash Transfer: @MinistryWCD pic.twitter.com/OdqjfK6bdA  — Ministry of WCD (@MinistryWCD) October 12, 2017  Rakesh Srivastava, secretary to the Women and Child Development Ministry, had said in September 2017, 'There is no plan to remove hot cooked meals. It is a part of the National Food Security Act. The role of anganwadis in cooking hot meals for children and women is specified in Section 5 and 6 of the Act. The central ministry provides only guidelines to the states. But states cannot violate the Act. If they do, they can be taken to court.' On Thursday, the NITI Aayog conducted the first meeting of the 'National Council on India's Nutrition Challenges.' The body's vice chairman, Rajiv Kumar, said, 'NITI Aayog will work to rank the states on their efforts to reduce malnutrition.'  #NITIAayog will work to rank the states on their efforts to reduce malnutrition.

He launched his party Karnataka Pragnyavanta Janata Paksha on October 31. However, this party was already registered in the name of Mahesh Gowda. The party was originally registered by Mahesh Gowda. However, he gifted it to Upendra as Upendra's objectives were in tandem with the Party. Mahesh Gowda is said to be an owner of an industry. He had registered the Karnataka Pragnyavanta Janata Paksha with the Election Commission in 2015. He is said to be actor Upendra's ardent fan too.     Mahesh Gowda's wife had contested for the BBMP election from Hegganahalli ward as an independent candidate under Karnataka Pragyavanta Janata Paksha (KPJP) but had lost the election. When Upendra came up with a party and tentatively named it as Uttama Praja Paksha and revealed the aims of the party, Mahesh Gowda had a discussion with the star and agreed to give away the party to Upendra. It was said that the ideology and aims of Mahesh Gowda and Upendra were same. Another reason cited was that it would take another six months to register a new party. But Upendra wants his people to contest from KPJP in the next Assembly elections scheduled to be held at the beginning of May next year. Thus registering a new party will not be feasible at this time (just months before next elections) and that's why the talks were held between Mahesh Gowda who readily agreed to give away his party to Upendra.

Right? Mukesh Ambani is the most renowned businessman in India. He even comes in the list of leading successful people in the world. If we talk about the development Ambani Group has made, we all know that Mukesh Ambani left no stone unturned to achieve everything he has today. His hard work is the reason that today he stands at the point where he can have anything he wants. But even after being on cloud 9, he has his feet on the ground.  Looking at the lifestyle of Ambani family, you must think that they obviously enjoy their life to the fullest? Ambani being such a billionaire, his kids must have a royal life too. Right?  So, what I have brought for you people today is some inside information of Ambani family which will clear all your queries. Let's see what is the pocket money of Ambani kids. Mukesh Ambani is the most successful businessman among the Ambani group. And when it comes to the personal life, he is a successful father as well.   Mukesh and Nita Ambani have made sure to grow up their kids Isha, Anant and Akash in proper guidance to make them better human beings.   Though Nita is the wife of the biggest businessmen in the country, she makes sure that her kids don't get into the glamour of money. Nita herself is from a middle-class family and for going to her college or school, she used to take a local bus.   Rather than sending kids in their personal luxury cars, Nita Ambani used to send her kids to school by the public transport bus. This was to make them aware of the lifestyle and problems of a common man. "Life is about being aware of things around," says Nita.   During an interview in 2011, Nita revealed that "When my kids were still young, I'd give them Rs 5 each and every Friday to spend in the school canteen."   But one day...    "One day, my youngest, Anant, came running into my bedroom and demanded for Rs 10 instead," Nita said.    "When I questioned him, he said..."     "When I questioned him, he said his pals in school laughed whenever they saw him take out a five-rupee coin saying,'Tu Ambani hai ya bhikari!' Mukesh and I couldn't help but crack up," Nita added.   As I have already told you that Nita Ambani is from a middle-class family, she narrates, " My mum was a disciplinarian and we were barely allowed to go out - just four times in a year - and there was no pocket money given. Not to mention my curfew, which was midnight."   Before getting married to Mukesh Ambani, Nita always wanted to become a teacher. But after marriage, she got into the responsibility of the family.And you wouldn't believe how Nita's maids call her...  Nita Ambani, just like her husband has feet on the ground. An example for this is that the maids in her house don't call her Madam or Mrs Ambani, they call her 'Bhabhi'.  I hope you liked the story.  Got a story?

The rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in India has provoked tensions between the Hindu and Muslim community. According to the police, Asifa Bano was drugged with sedatives and then forced to endure three days of rape by multiple men, before being strangled to death in the town of Kathua. An 8-year-old girl was raped and then brutally murdered, and then there are still people defending the rapists. The thought of people defending criminals like that is almost as disturbing as the crime itself.  Amidst this horrific situation, one voice that is fighting hard to stay strong is that of Deepika Singh Rajawat. She is the lawyer representing the Kathua rape victim's family bring their innocent daughter to justice and has also become an internet sensation with her hellbent attitude in fighting for what's right. Twitter users praised her strength amidst the furore brought about by the case. The picture shows her leaving the Supreme Court to address the media, where she admits that since taking the case - which her colleagues tried to prevent the police from filing - she is afraid of being "raped [and killed]". She told to media. But, even with all the support she's getting online, it's so shameful that there are still people out there who are against her. She was quoted by ANI saying, "Today, I don't know, I am not in my senses. I can be raped, I can be killed and maybe they won't allow me to practice in court. They (have) isolated me, I don't know how I can survive." But, even with all that, she's no way backing down. She said, "I am feeling bad and it's really unfortunate. You can well imagine my plight. But, I will stand for justice and we would seek justice for the eight-year-old girl." Her bravery has been noted by many. She refuses to be cowed by threats made against her, and tweeted: "I am not scared of threats, will fights this case and make sure our child gets the Justice." Rajawat runs an NGO called Voice For Rights, which helps under privileged people, especially women and children whose human rights has been violated.

Mahaakshay Chakraborty trolled for his picture with porn star Kayden Kross | Remember Mahaakshay Chakraborty aka Mimoh? After disappearing from Bollywood, the actor is back in spotlight and not exactly for the right reasons. Mahaakshay recently posted a picture with an adult star, Kayden Kross, and it has gone viral. On September 24, Mahaakshay Chakraborty uploaded a picture on his Instagram handle with Kayden and he reportedly met her on Los Angeles. He seemed to be 'awestruck' after meeting her and the full caption with the picture was, "That moment when you meet the Beautiful and oh so humble @clubkayden !!! #awestruck #dreamcometrue #fanboy #fanboymoment #kaydenkross #kayden #starstruck". As expected, this 'dream come true' moment of Mahaakshay Chakraborty was not liked by one and all. Many ridiculed him for being a fan of a porn actress. For those who don't know, Kayden Kross started out in the adult entertainment industry at age 18 as a stripper in California. She was subsequently contacted by an adult industry agent who helped her get work as a nude model in various men's magazines. She then graduated to doing porn films and off late, she has also tried her hand at blogging. Mahaakshay Chakraborty is the son of Mithun and was launched in 2008 with Jimmy. But it flopped miserably. His second film Haunted however was a huge hit and set the trend for 3D films. But the film didn't help the actor much. His subsequent films - Loot, Enemmy and Ishqedarriyaan - bombed at the box office. Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 07 Oct, 5.21 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cricket-epaper-cricket/prithvi+shaw+shows+humility+after+tendulkar+comparison-newsid-81465872| News Prithvi Shaw shows humility after Tendulkar comparison |    CHENNAI: Skipper Prithvi Shaw invited various comments - most of which cannot be published here - from the Australian fielders during both his knocks at the Under-19 World Cup. However, there was one positive comment during his knock of 94 against the same opposition in their group stage game. The 18-year-old stroked an almost flawless off-drive for four. His bat position was right from the coaching manual and Ian Bishop, who was on air, summed up the sentiments in three words. "That is (Sachin) Tendulkar". People echoed similar sentiments on social media.  It's easy for young turks to get carried away by comparisons like those - many have, in fact, fallen by the wayside after being given the tag of the next . So how is Shaw handling the pressure? If his words are anything to go by, pretty well. Heck, he even managed to refer Tendulkar as a 'God of cricket' to win a few fans.  "Expectations will be there from outside the field and everyone," he told select reporters after Mumbai's Vijay Hazare match against Tamil Nadu on Thursday. "Obviously people will compare (me) with Sachin sir or anyone else. But I know my game and I better be grounded because he is (a) God of cricket. I have not even started and he played international cricket for more than 20 years." That journey, he hopes, will lead to a few India caps in the near future but he doesn't yet know whether he is ready. "I don't know," he said. "I think so... I have to keep scoring runs. Opportunities milega (I will get my chance). I have to grab those to be there in the senior team." The 18-year-old, who was a bit reluctant to talk to the media at first (he had to be cajoled by the team manager), also revealed an interesting insight into the Rahul Dravid school of coaching. "He didn't talk much about technique... he spent time talking about the mental aspects. He helped on the mental side."

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/youngisthan-epaper-youngeng/find+out+swami+madhu+sudan+ji+s+adhyatm+yoga+mission+and+how+it+s+helpful-newsid-73374418|  Home Find Out Swami Madhu Sudan Ji's "Adhyatm Yoga Mission" And How It's HELPFUL! |  Adhyatm Yoga Mission - "Adhyatm Yoga Mission" was established in the year 1991, yet there are not many who are unaware about it. Who invented it, you ask? Well, it was established by Swami Madhu Sudan Ji as he was inspired by his Sadguru, the great Saint Kula Nand Bramchari Ji. What exactly is "Adhyatm Yoga Mission?" Firstly, let me add that the world has no independent exists. It exists because Brahman or Absolute exits forever. This mission says that it's important to know ourselves BEFORE we connect to God. It says that without the knowledge of one's self, it is clearly impossible to connect with God. The unimaginable God certainly cannot be known to us IF we don't know the knowledge that we, humans holds within. Most importantly, this mission speaks that it's important not to live with an ego. With an ego, nobody can have a relationship with God. But thus, one that has the right knowledge of Formless God i.e. the unimaginable God can easily devote himself. By having a knowledge, it becomes easy to connect and the peaceful happenings that one experiences later results into connecting with God. It's all about surrendering completely to God and only then one can experience that He exists.  This mission strongly believes in establishing universal brotherhood in society so that one realizes the powers and creations of God by leading a virtuous LIFE.    FOUR WAYS: Adhyatm Yoga Mission includes 4 ways of God's realization i.e. Knowledge Of God.   Karma-Yoga  This yoga is mainly for assiduous people. Assiduous are people who are careful, methodical and persistent in nature. Karma Yoga leads to doing selfless service without expecting anything return.  Bhakti-Yoga  This yoga is for people who are devotional in nature i.e. they worship God. It is done as a path of self-realization.  Bhakti yoga leads to devotion.  Raj-Yoga  It is for esoteric people i.e. people who are most likely to be understood by a small group of people having similar interests. It leads to self-discipline.  Jnan-Yoga  It is for the ones equipped with the faculty of discrimination. Other than that; it leads to prudence i.e. one who needs to be careful while taking decisions to do things. Whatever you do, whatever you eat or whatever you give, do it entirely as an offer to God. Live in peace, and let go your egoism. Most importantly, serve God and only then you'll be able to FIND the peace that you're desperate to have. Have Faith in yourself and make sure to meditate on a daily basis. Speak the truth and stop lying. Kill your FEARS and most importantly, your ANGER. Practically, Yoga is a way of life and it comes in many forms. Adhyatm Yoga Mission is one of it and it appreciates the basic principles of all the virtual values. This mission is not created to drag any religious or hurt anyone's sentiments, but it's just a pure form of connecting with God by experiencing peace. It strongly believes in leading people towards light, love, strength, peace, self-confidence. It makes sure to take a person, no matter what religion he/she shares, from out of the weakness, darkness and any negative thoughts. This mission also entirely focuses on the 3 types of impurities i.e. Mal (impurities of body and organs), Vikshep (attachment relating in wandering of mind) and Avaran (ego in intellect) To get closer and understand the knowledge Of God, one has to understand these principles to lead a peaceful Godly LIFE.  Unfailing adherence to "Yogah Karmsu Kaushalam." Freedom from the ego. (It is a must-thing. One should not have any ego in heart and should be capable of knowing one-self) To shun the burden of ego on account of body, richness as these are just the gifts given by our God. Discrimination shouldn't be practiced.  Now, you must've got an idea about what exactly the mission is all about. To make it clearer, it is all about establishing unity and universal brotherhood. God is one and it can be realized with the grace of Sadguru in body and form.  This was all about " Adhyatm Yoga Mission ".  Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 16 Sep, 8.36 am

This new concept will be helpful for those people who live in urban areas but have a desire to rear cattle to produce "quality milk" for consumption.

This initiative will boost white revolution in the state. The dairy business is a profitable industry in India. Hence the idea will be helpful for that too. Along with cattle owners living in the small house, PG owners will also like the system as they would be getting the milk free of cost from those cattle.  To make Haryana the best state in milk production, a three-day Haryana Swarna Jayanti Cattle Fair will start from October 27. While Haryana governor Kaptan Singh Solanki will inaugurate the fair, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar will be present on the concluding day, October 29.

Photo by: Ron Gaunt / IPL/ SPORTZPICS If catches win matches, then Sunrisers Hyderabad deserves to be on the winning side in their ongoing game against Mumbai Indians. Their star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan took an absolute stunner to get rid of the dangerous Rohit Sharma early in the innings. On the other hand, the smart catch extended Rohit Sharma's poor start to the IPL.  The Mumbai Indians skipper had failed to get going in the season-opener against Chennai Super Kings. As a result, he started cautiously against the hosts. The India star would have made his way out of the ground in the very first over. However, Deepak Hooda dropped a tough chance. But the right-handed batsman failed to capitalise on it and departed quite early, much to the relief of Hooda and Sunrisers. Rohit was batting on 11 off 9 when he flicked a Billy Stanlake delivery. He was not in control of the shot and as a result the ball took the aerial rout. But is still looked safe as it was falling in front of Shakib who was standing at short square leg. However, Shakib dived forward and got both hands underneath to take a brilliant catch. Outstanding catch by @Sah75official to dismiss Rohit Sharma. #IPL2018 #SRHvMI pic.twitter.com/8kkcPICbMY— Peshwa Bajirao (@PeshwaBajirao7) April 12, 2018  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 12 Apr, 8.46 pma week agoa week agoa week agoa week ago3 days ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/rera+karnataka+five+things+you+need+to+know+before+buying+home-newsid-70032087| Home RERA Karnataka: Five things you need to know before buying home | The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 also known as RERA will be implemented in Karnataka soon. RERA is an Act of the Parliament of India which seeks to protect homebuyers as well as help boost investments in the real estate industry. Thus the Karnataka government is all set to bring this law into effect and here is good news for the home buyers. Here are the five important things to know about RERA before you buy a home.  1) RERA is not applicable in these instances  The ongoing projects with more than 60 % of the work completed and those who have been given sale deeds will come under the new RERA rule. This move has disappointed the home-buyers who feel that it will affect the assessment at the completion of work. They feel the developers may manipulate the provisions of Real Estate Regulatory and Development Act as they are excluded from it.   2) Karnataka first to draft but going slow on implementing   RERA come into force on May 1. But only 11 states and 7 UTs have notified state rules while rest are in the process. In fact, Karnataka was the first state to notify the draft rules last year, but it is yet to come out with the final rules and set up a state-level regulatory authority mandated by the Act.  3) Waiting for final notification  The final notification of rules under RERA in Karnataka is still not out. It is not possible to get the complete picture until all provisions are put on the table.  4) Who comes under RERA  Those who are yet to start the construction of their buildings or in the initial stages of construction come under the RERA. It is mandatory to the new builders to follow the rules and fix feasible rates for the flats as mentioned in the RERA.  5) No more delay in handing over the house, no extra charge  According to RERA no builder can delay the completion of the project and will have to hand over the flat to the customers on time, as promised by the builder. In the process, if the house is completed within time, there is no reason for the builder to ask additional amount than decided earlier.  6) Size of the house matters  The new Act applies to all houses in the initial stage of building and yet to be commenced which are a minimum of 500 square metre or any residential projects which have eight flats. The flats cannot be sold unless the project plan is registered at the Controlling Authority. If the developers fail to stand by the rules, the registration can be cancelled by the authorities concerned. The authorities can even freeze the bank account used to make transactions for the project. Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 08 Jul, 4.02 pm

The space thriller will see Varun donning an astronaut's role with Aditi playing his colleague. The duo will be seen working together on a space mission in the film. "Aditi was quite impressed by the intriguing and fresh script that Sankalp narrated to her. The filmmakers were initially apprehensive if she'd be interested in the project, but were ecstatic seeing her enthusiasm after listening to the script; it was a boost for them," shares a reliable source.    Since it will be a space film, for which Varun has undergone some preliminary training in Kazakhstan, Aditi will be expected to do the same. However, the film will have one more female lead. "The other actress will have a comparatively small, but important role. She will be Varun's love interest," adds the source.

The incident happened almost a month back in Ramgarh district of Jharkhand. The dead body of the victim, who had gone missing since November 6th, was recovered with her hands and legs tied, near the bank of river Garna. The post-mortem confirmed the victim was gang-raped before being murdered. The police acted swiftly after the body's recovery and arrested the girl's lover, Adil, who made several revelations during an investigation. As per the police, the victim married Adil against their parents' choice last month and the couple reached his uncle's home in Bokaro. The uncle, in return, informed Adil's father and called him at his place. The couple, then were told by the father-uncle that since the girl is of different religion, she has to convert herself to Islam first. However, this demand was immediately turned down by the girl, after which the father offered to drop the duo to a nearest railway station so that they could head to Ranchi and live there. However, the father-uncle took the couple to a jungle route via Rajabeda Halt where they took turns to rape the girl and later killed her in the bushes. The girl's lover Adil told the police that while he resisted his father-uncle's motives, he too was tied by them while they committed the crime. On the other hand, the victim's family alleged that Adil's family misled them for over a month about the whole affair. Meanwhile, after the news spread, several Hindu groups protested against the murder and called it a case of love-jihad.Dailyhunt	|Friday, 29 Dec, 12.48 pm

For he will be exposed to some unfriendly music on the streets of London on Wednesday If Narendra Modi felt relieved about escaping from the prevalent heat of Indian politics -"Go Back Modi" signs in Chennai, rapes and murders in Kathua, Unnao and Surat and cash running out at ATMs-he was mistaken. For he will be exposed to some unfriendly music on the streets of London on Wednesday. Permission has been granted by the city's Metropolitan Police force, better known as Scotland Yard-as is customary in Britain-to various discontented groups to protest for up to three hours from midday within earshot of Modi's meetings with the British leadership. Thousands of protestors could, in fact, mushroom for the purpose.  Indeed, Modi will not enter Downing Street-where the office and residence of the British Prime Minister Theresa May is located -through its front gate. He will be surreptitiously smuggled in through an alternative internal route to bypass the demonstrations that are slated to take place against him. Indian women, students, Dalits and Christians will bolster the protests. South Asia Solidarity Group (SASG), a left-wing organisation, will also agitate. These would be embarrassing for India, because the immediate trigger for their action is the apparent protection that was sought to be given to the suspected rapists and murders in Kathua and Unnano, who either owe allegiance to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party or is a BJP lawmaker, and alleged ill-treatment of socially underprivileged sections and minorities in India. "We will meet to publicly express our pain, sorrow and shock and most of all condemn the raping of our little daughters in India," the otherwise pro-India women declared. The SASG described Modi as an "avowed fascist and admirer of (Adolf) Hitler". It accused him of "overseeing genocidal attacks and mob lynching against religious minorities". No visiting Indian politician has ever been accused of such serious omissions and commissions on British soil.  The protests would be embarrassing for India, because the immediate trigger for their action is the apparent protection that was sought to be given to the suspected rapists and murders in Kathua and Unnano, who either owe allegiance to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party or is a BJP lawmaker, and alleged ill-treatment of socially underprivileged sections and minorities in India  Then, there will be the usual suspects-elements inimical to India-who will stage rallies alongside the genuinely aggrieved demonstrators. Farooq Haider, the so-called prime minister of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, has flown to London and is reported to be preparing to lead an anti-India rally. Haider was quoted by Geo News as saying he was in London to "show solidarity" with people in Indian-controlled Kashmir. He said he was going to confront Modi on what he called "atrocities against Kashmiris under his watch". Khalistani separatists belonging to Babbar Khalsa-one of whose leaders is said to be in Pakistan-are expected to join hands with the Kashmiris to ventilate their anti-India venom. Lord Nazir Ahmed, a Mirpur-born British peer who is known to be close to the Pakistani establishment, has been proudly proclaiming on social media that he is involved in organising the combined front. Not that Rawalpindi needs an excuse, but the acute failure of Modi's Kashmir policy has given Pakistan a stick to beat India with. Considering the way the former prime minister and Muslim League president Nawaz Sharif has been unceremoniously side-lined for his lack of sufficient hostility towards India in the eyes of the Pakistani army, politicians in Pakistan-previously inclined towards talks with India-have switched to toeing the hard-line of the military. The shrillest of sounds have emanated from Bilawal Bhutto of Pakistan People's Party; while Imran Khan, who spearheads the Justice Party and is fancying himself as the next prime minister with the aid of the army, gave a notably hawkish interview to Russia Today on Monday night. British police will, of course, endeavour to ensure Haider and company come nowhere close to Modi as the latter is whisked in and out of Downing Street, perhaps even at a time when the demonstrations either haven't started or have finished. But the Indian High Commission in London and Modi's Special Protection Group have unmistakably been flagging their concerns about the protests. It was disclosed at a briefing by the mission that it had gone to the extent of conveying to British authorities they should ensure "no bomb" is thrown at or in the path of Modi. Throughout his three-visit to the British capital, Modi will, in fact, travel in a bullet-proof limousine; whereas most if not all other heads of government attending the Commonwealth summit on Thursday and Friday will be transported from venue to venue on coaches in a community spirit. This suggests the threat perception regarding Modi was not to be taken lightly.  Counter-protests by Modi fans The UK-based Overseas Friends of BJP, which is a front organisation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, have, however, been working around the clock to mount counter demonstrations against what they maintained are "anti-India forces". In a propaganda war, both sides will deploy double-decker buses and vans with electronic screens in the Whitehall and Westminster areas-the government and parliamentary districts of London-to publicise their respective provocative messages. In this respect, activists loyal to India were first off the block with a floodlight message projected on the exterior walls of the British Houses of Parliament, demanding Pakistan be questioned on crimes against humanity in Balochistan.   London-based Ashish Ray, former head of CNN in India, is the longest serving Indian foreign correspondent  The protests would be embarrassing for India, because the immediate trigger for their action is the apparent protection that was sought to be given to the suspected rapists and murders in Kathua and Unnano, who either owe allegiance to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party or is a BJP lawmaker, and alleged ill-treatment of socially underprivileged sections and minorities in India National Herald Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 18 Apr, 9.29 am3 days ago5 days ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/new+property+registration+system+to+be+launched+by+telangana+govt-newsid-86019932| Top Stories New property registration system to be launched by Telangana govt |  HYDERABAD: Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that Telangana will have a new property registration system from June to check corruption and delay besides ensuring transparency in the registration process.  Mr Rao said Dharani website will be launched for the purpose which will offer property registration services similar to that of core banking services system wherein property buyers and sellers will get instant messages on their mobile phones in case of any transaction on their properties.   The CM held a review meeting with the senior officials of Revenue, Stamps and Registration and IT departments at Pragathi Bhavan on Wednesday.  Mr Rao asked the officials to implement a pilot project on Dharani website in five mandals in the first phase and 30 mandals in the second phase before its launch in June. He instructed the officials to rectify any errors or deficiencies in the website, if any, that gets noticed during the course of pilot project implementation. Under the new system, the property buyers and sellers will have to seek the appointment of a Sub-Registrar similar to that for passport. The Sub-Registrar will enter the land details in the passbook of the buyer and delete the same from the seller's book instantly on the appointment day. The details will be uploaded on Dharani and passbooks will be sent through courier like passport. There will be no need to bribe officials for this purpose which is a major complaint received at all Sub-Registrar offices currently.  The CM said that all MROs will be entrusted with the duties of Sub-Registrar from June. With this, each mandal will have its own Sub-Registar from June unlike 141 Sub-Registrar offices at present that covers all the mandals. This will prevent delay in property registrations at mandal- level. The training programmes for staff on Dharani website and registrations will be held from May 7 to 19.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/daily+post-epaper-dpost/10+used+cars+that+you+should+avoid+buying-newsid-76815820| Top News 10 used cars that you should avoid buying |  1. Ford Explorer   The Ford Explorer has been a popular vehicle since it was released in 1991 and is one of the safest SUVs on the road today. While it may have plenty of safety features that gets it placed on many "safest" lists, the Explorer is plagued by other issues that make it a very questionable choice for a used vehicle. The transmission is the source of many of the Explorers problems, with failures resulting in costly repairs. Many users also complain about paint issues, which leads to rust on the body of the vehicle. Before buying a used Explorer, it would be wise to do some research first.   2. Audi Q5    The Audi Q5 was a hit when it first hit the market. The compact SUV was loaded with luxury features and had a fantastic interior. The suspension and steering were well built, offering exceptional handling and comfort. The engine was a powerful V-6 that gave owners plenty of pep to zoom down the road. Overall, it didn't seem like the Q5 was flawed at all. Sadly, the Q5 has a number of reliability issues. Consumer Reports gave the Audi Q5 its worst rating for overall reliability. According to various forums there are numerous complaints about the climate control, navigation system, keyless entry, and the stereo system. This wasn't just for the first few model years either, these complaints haunt to Q5 throughout all model years. Best to steer clear of this vehicle all together.   3. Jeep Wrangler    The Jeep Wrangler is a great vehicle, the problem when buying a used Wrangler is you don't know how the previous owner treated it. The Wrangler is a very common off-road vehicle, and enthusiasts love to push these vehicles to their limit. For all you know that clean looking Wrangler for sale has been ridden hard and put away wet its entire life, and now the owner slapped it with a good cleaning and is passing it off as a great vehicle. Another issue regarding the Wrangler is the number of recalls that have plagued it for the past 10 years. Every model of Wrangler since 2005 has had a recall for various parts. Brakes, transmission, fuel system, wiring, engine system, emissions systems, and more have all had recalls. The issues end up fixed, but that's only if the owner actually took the vehicle in to have the problem rectified. Unless you can be certain of the vehicles past, the Wrangler is a used vehicle you should overlook.   4. BMW X5    The BMW X5 first hit the scene in 2000. The luxury SUV was praised for it's performance and high end interior. The suspension was given praise for offering a smooth, comfortable ride as well as reducing body roll. As a used vehicle, the X5 can be very pricey, mainly due to the BMW name. Owners on forums have a number of complaints about the X5 though. Reliability issues are a significant problem with many owners. The all-wheel drive system, electrical system, and drive shaft are all areas of concern for the X5, and the problems seem to affect all model years. For such an expensive used car, you are better off looking elsewhere. No reason to spend that much on a vehicle with so many user complaints.   5. Cadillac STS    The Cadillac STS was built for 6 years, between 2005 and 20011. When it was released it garnered praise for its comfortable ride and great handling. It was offered with a choice of V-6 and V-8 engines, both of which are costly to repair when problems occur. The STS was given low marks for overall dependability by J.D. Power. Engine, transmission, electrical, and braking system problems are commonly reported problems for the STS. The fuel system, cooling system, and navigation system are also common problem areas. With so many problems and the cost to fix them being so high, the Cadillac STS is one of the worst used cars you can buy.   6. Chevrolet Aveo    The Aveo was replaced by the Chevrolet Sonic in 2012, and it couldn't have come soon enough. The Aveo was a subcompact car with few redeeming qualities. Outside of a low price and high gas mileage, the Aveo didn't bring much to the table. A tiny 103 horsepower engine made driving feel like a chore, especially when climbing steep hills. The interior was covered in cheap plastic, reminding you of how low end the vehicle is every time you got climbed into it. On top of the poor qualities of the vehicle when new, the Aevo is known for having problems with the fuel system, brakes, and audio system.     7. Chrysler Sebring    The Chrysler Sebring was manufactured between 1995 and 2010 and is one of the most repair prone vehicles on the market. Engine issues were the most prevalent issue with these year Sebrings, with oil sludge causing a majority of the engine failures. Oil leaks, engine knocks, and blown head gaskets are also among the more frequent problems. The AC / heating system was another place where the Sebring often failed. The blower only working on high, water pooling on the floor, and the heater / AC failing to work at all are the most common complaints.   8. Pontiac Aztek    This weird looking car was built between 2001 and 2005 by Pontiac. The boxy shape and terrible paint color options caused a lot of criticism, but the vehicle did work well as a crossover. Large cargo area and plenty of features enticed some people to purchase the Aztek, and the success of the TV show Breaking Bad breathed new life into the vehicle as a popular used car purchase. Sadly the vehicle didn't fare well as time took it's toll, and the 2002 model year in particular was plagued with problems. Problems from the car refusing to start, to motor mounts rubbing through wiring harnesses are reported by owners of the vehicle.     9. Chevrolet Blazer    The Chevy Blazer was one of the more popular SUVs in its day. The vehicle was discontinued in 2005, but they are still seen on used car lots. The Blazer scored low in crash tests, which throws up a red flag out of the gate, but the vehicle is also haunted by reliability issues. Consumers report a slew of issues with the Blazer on various forums. The top complaint is that the engine frequently stalls or bogs down while driving, sometimes this happens without warning after the car has been running for hours. No start issues, acceleration problems, fuel problems, transmission problems, and electrical problems are also commonly reported.     10. Chrysler PT Cruiser    The Pt earn the nickname "PT Loser" for no reason. While the vehicle may have sold well and received praise when it first arrived on the scene in 2001 for it's looks and features, the vehicle had mediocre performance scores. The years didn't do this vehicle any favors, as it has a number of issues reported by owners. The complaint that is most prevalent with the PT Cruiser is oil consumption. The engines burn through oil like gas, and end up needing a quart of oil every 500 miles driven. Even after engine replacements, the vehicle still ends up consuming oil. Other areas of concern include the electrical system, transmission, fuel system. and airbag system.        Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 22 Nov, 5.24 am

After the team's win, Karthik said, "Feels good to get two wins on the trot. Slowly things are going in a good direction. Just feel that the wrist-spinners are a little harder to pick. For the fast bowlers, it could come onto the bat. So it makes sense to go with spinners at the top. Spinners did a good job for us. The way Robin batted was fantastic. He set the tone for us. Nitish is getting used to that role where he's coming not out which is good to see."  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 11.42 am9 hrs agoyesterdaya week ago2 weeks ago2 weeks ago

I don't have anybody else giving me better work. I came here with a very clear vision with what to do as an actor. I didn't come here to be a star, fame or the money or the accessories that come with it.' 'I really don't care if people don't click a picture with me on a red carpet. I came with a vision in the industry and I am doing it. I am going in front of the camera and acting, something that really gives me joy. As long as I am doing that, I will be happy. But when there come movies that you are not enjoying, then regardless of the fact whether it is a big project or small, I will not do it,' she points out.The actress says she is not someone who does 'song, dance or two-three scenes and be very happy in life'.'That is not my zone. So the only reason I am working with this team is as they understand my vision. Even though they have given me roles that are not typical heroine roles like they are a little grey, but I think I need to set something apart for myself. If I keep doing those same heroine roles then I will be lost in the crowd,' she adds.'So I got a good streak to do something negative, grey, caricaturish -- and at the same time -- something so novel that people are wanting more of it. So I like that identity a lot. Today people know that I am the 'Punchnama girl'. There is no other girl with this tag. So I feel that the association works for me well and it gives me an edge over other people,' the 'Akaash Vani' actor fame says.Whether she has fears of being stereotyped as the 'Punchnama girl', Nushrat is clear: 'It's an another challenge then. And it's good that I have challenges. If I do get stereotyped then I will look out for roles that will break it. Then I will be happy that I am doing something different from my previous roles. But after this film people will see me in a different light.'Her father Tanvir Bharucha is a renowned theatre actor. When asked whether she has any apprehensions about theatre, the 32-year-old actor admits, 'Yes I do have. I think it's a very difficult medium for me to do. Because the live performance is something very different. When I see plays, I get really scared. I can't overcome that fear that I have to play that character in 360 degrees.''In films there are retakes. But I think I am spoiled of taking retakes in the movies. But in theatre you get only one chance where you have to perform and that is very scary for me,' she states.On being asked if she gets affected by the box office numbers, Nushrat says, 'Personally, I don't get affected. But it's a trick question. Because tomorrow when I will go to meet a producer or director, he will cast me in a big budget films depending on what my previous film's success was.''My definition of it doesn't really matters. Audience is there to define for me. Hence, it becomes a game of numbers, whether I, believe it or not. Eventually I am not defined as the actor I am, or my any other talent, they define it as how much business the movie has earned,' she notes.Talking about her equation with Kartik and director Luv Ranjan, Nushrat elaborates: 'It's a love/hate relationship. Over time we have become more calmer, patient with each other, and more understanding towards each other. As a team, we have not only grown in our content, we have grown as individuals together. So I love the journey.'Asked her view on killings committed in the name of love, Nushrat states, 'I feel violence of any sort defies our definition of who we are as human beings. We are not animals that we kill each other. We are civilised species who have better, bigger things to do. I don't condone it and I am against all sort of violence.'The actress said the directors on her wishlist whom she wants to work with in the future are Imtiaz Ali, Abhishek Chaubey and Vishal Bhardwaj.About any roles she want to portray on screen, Nushrat says, 'I want to do 'Highway', if ever there is a remake of it or Alia's character in 'Udta Punjab'. I would also love to do what Kangana is doing in her life -- like her character in 'Queen' or 'Tanu weds Manu''Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety' is an upcoming Hindi romantic comedy film directed by Luv Ranjan. This is the fourth collaboration between Luv Ranjan and the lead actors Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha after having worked together in 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama', 'Akaash Vani' and 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' previously.The story revolves around Titu (Sunny Singh) who is getting married to a girl named Sweety (Nushrat Bharucha) who comes across as a perfect woman, but Titu's friend Sonu (Kartik Aaryan) finds her too good to be true. While Titu and his family are impressed with everything that Sweety does, Sonu, on the other hand, finds her behaviour suspicious and develops doubts over her true intentions. This leads to conflict between Sonu and Sweety with both trying to outdo each other in order to achieve their goal.The film is scheduled to release on February 23.

Inspired way before the talking, pot-smoking bear from the movie Ted hit the screens, the account takes satirical digs through seasoned memes on NaMo, annoying Indian habits and a whole lot more. In 2015, the page was taken down by Facebook for being "offensive", but Ted's back at it again.The page, that surprisingly has a strong international fanbase, takes a generous dig at everyday Indian habits and governance with a dab of sarcasm and a pinch of humour.Ted's rule is simple - Do not follow me if you are easily offended! We caught up with Ted The Stoner and talked about his actual intentions - to spread common sense, awareness and a lot of good humour.   Excerpts from a 'memeingful' interview:     Who is Jitendra Sharma?  I was born and brought up in Mumbai and my life revolves around balance sheets and audits. I love writing in my free time and I also enjoy doing amateur sketches. We can be friends if you can share your pizza.Why 'Ted the stoner'? Was it meant to be some sort of secret identity?   Oh no. I never really felt the need to keep the identity a secret because initially it just started as a time-killing activity and I just wanted to explore what it's like to be on the other side of the curtain. What did you initially aim to do with the page when you started? Has it changed along the way?   It was probably 2 am when I created the page. I felt like there were very few pages that I could connect with on a humoristic level, so why not give it a try. Quality content was the initial aim, however, in 2015 the page was taken down by Facebook due to reasons unknown and then I switched to Instagram. After it got a massive boost, I thought 'why just stick to jokes when you can actually influence people and do something bigger'. That's when the rants began and it gained momentum after getting a few celebrity followers, but yes, the purpose did change somewhere down the line. Your page often analyses and highlights daily laxities in our country's functioning. A raging passion of yours?    I don't really find it difficult to express what is wrong with, or even appreciate our system. People like you and I just possess the knowledge of words. Like they say, words can spit venom or mend a broken soul. I do my best to use available resources for a greater good and try my best to make this world a better place. People do listen to everything you say when there is a crowd listening to you. But they will probably believe a lie even if a few thousand people nod in agreement. So, why not turn it around and let them see the truth for themselves?Is it hard to deliver that every day to thousands of followers?  It does get difficult at times when you touch upon a sensitive topic, but all I have learnt from this is that you cannot silence your inner voice just to please a few hundred people. If you believe that you are contributing to the good in the world, do not waste a second thinking about the backlash you will receive. It's all background noise. You are very critical of the government. Your thoughts on dissent and free speech, especially after your page was taken down?   I have always been critical of what I have felt is wrong, whether the problem was us as people or the government, in more than a few cases. I feel that we all have a role to play in the functioning of a modern society and we cannot simply be bystanders when we clearly possess the knowledge and education. Free speech is something I never really had a problem with, well, at least until the page was deleted. I shall continue to present my views/opinions and be unapologetic, while I shall always do my best to keep an open-minded discussion. But hey, no complains, no regrets.         Haters gonna hate: Receiving threats, allegations and offensive rebuttals have now become a way of life for Jitendra     Taking offense is our country's daily bread. For someone who dwells on offending conservatives through ' unsanskaari ' memes, how much does it take for you to not burst a vein?  I did get riled up back in 2011 when people did not agree with or got offended by my posts. Gradually, it became amusing. A year or two later, I found myself completely unaffected by what's happening on the internet. I only deliver my opinions and views. I don't think about the responses. I did enjoy offending conservatives a few years ago, but that is more of a byproduct now. I do my best to do justice to my bio, which claims to be changing mindsets. I honestly try my level best to educate people on the bitter truth rather than comfort them with a sweet lie. Some of the craziest responses or threats you've received?  Every response is crazy. Threats are usually funny because they usually come from 16 to 20-year-old teenagers. There was this guy who set up around ten profiles asking me for my address so that he could fight me. I finally gave him the CBI headquarters address in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). Haven't heard from him since. Humour and memes - what do you make of them?  Happiness comes in various forms. For some, it can be food or dogs or the people around them. I guess humour and memes are just another form of happiness. Everybody on this planet needs to have a good sense of humour. I mean, if we don't keep ourselves happy, who will? Memes are often used to target individuals personally. It is pathetic to actually bully someone you have no business with. These are mostly done by 15 to 18-year-old, self-proclaimed trolls with their own gag pages.      Meme boy: Ted aka Jitendra makes it clear that his page is not for those easily offended    Do you think you have loyal fans? What sort of a crowd do you cater to?   I know this sounds unbelievable, but I can safely put the hater: fan ratio to 1:1000. For every one hate message or comment, there are a thousand messages appreciating what I do. There are people who have always been supportive. I cannot really be bothered about haters because they're people I don't know. So in a way, I will never even know that I'm hated because I'm unaware of their existence. This is my wonderful logic. And I usually try my best to cater to a mixed audience and not a particular part of the crowd.      Support stream: Ted's followers, numbering around 380K followers, range from college students to young adults     Your views on the country's habit of deeming humour and satire a taboo, especially with regard to politics and religion?    I don't think I speak anything that is unique or different. I just speak what's on everyone's mind. A lot of us are just waiting to support someone who can pen down what they think. Mainstream media, politics and religion are a few topics which are always talked about in a hushed tone. We cannot shy away from these topics or silence ourselves because I believe that if we are capable enough to bring a change, create awareness or even rattle a few feathers, it becomes our moral responsibility to do so.   What do you draw inspiration from?   The biggest inspiration I draw would be from the people who have been ardently following me all these years. The consistent love and appreciation and above all, the satisfaction of seeing random strangers smile is the best feeling ever. Be it appreciation from someone serving our Indian Army, a kid going through a break-up, someone going through chemotherapy, every message I receive in support is beautiful in its own unique way. I do get extra happy when someone from the armed forces or someone suffering a terminal disease tells me that my page helps them smile. It is one of  the  greatest joys one can experience.     In your Instagram  bio , you mention changing mindsets. What is your plan?   I feel like my line in the bio is validated whenever someone messages me saying they felt differently about a particular topic but that they've changed after reading a rant on my page. At the end of the day, even if one person drops their conservative mindset, it's a victory for me. One step at a time I guess.       A little love: Ted's posts aren't all meme's and "offence" but also reaches out to fans with some extra love   Some of your memes could be considered offensive to certain groups and individuals. Are you sensitive to these factors while working?   (Laughs) Since this isn't really my work, I've honestly never given it much thought. I don't have a customer care department (for now). People can get offended by literally anything. I just post what I feel is right. I have my inner moral checks when I post. But I haven't changed my mind or refrained from posting something just because it would offend a section of people. I just make sure that I never personally hurt any individual with my posts. Some comedians/ people you draw inspiration from?  I appreciate the work of George Carlin, Louis C K and a few more. My mother is also a source of inspiration. Even if she's had a rough day, she always has this magical spark in her eyes and that positivity is contagious. I guess that is one trait I've picked up from her and I feel really lucky.   Where do you see the country heading to in terms of freedom and privacy? I'm pretty optimistic about our country's future because this is our time to do things, to bring change and be a part of it. We aren't spectators anymore. All these conservative party workers will vanish one fine day and we will actually be looking at educated and decent human beings in the Parliament. I believe in a better India. However, with recent advancements, I personally feel that privacy will be violated.

While the department has already set up several public toilets in areas with heavy to medium public movement and has directed private management of malls, petrol pumps, and food joint owners to allow people to use their restrooms, people still express their doubts on hygiene being maintained in such places. With no one to question the cleanliness standards maintained at the privately maintained spaces, the management too is turning a deaf ear to address the problems faced by people.  In a recent incident at Tarnaka, it was found that despite displaying showing signs of both 'She' and 'He' Toilets, there was only one restroom for common use at a petrol bunk but what shook the customer was that even that washroom did not have a water supply, and neither was the commode neatly washed. Disgusted with the ill-maintenance of sanitation levels in the petrol bunk, the customer on condition of anonymity said, " It is unfortunate all the drama on the name of Swachh Bharat is a failure when people cannot even relieve themselves at hygienic washrooms.  We can't take time and again blame GHMC for sanitation issues because it also depends on the mindset of these private managements. It is a shame that just to show put that they are serving the public, these people are actually playing with the lives of people. If someone contracts urinal disease after using such kind of toilets, it is these people who are supposed to be responsible for it. There is a strict need to have laws that tighten the grip of the municipality over sanitation issues prevalent in these privately maintained places of public movement."

Here are five players who can expect to hit it rich when the eight teams in the Twenty20 tournament place their bids in Bangalore:   - Ben Stokes (England) -  Rising Pune Supergiant bought the troubled England all-rounder last year for a record $2.16 million. Stokes now faces a looming court case over a brawl in England, but IPL sides are still keen to sign the star who played a key role as Pune finished runners-up in 2017. The 26-year-old paceman and left-hand batsman is in the top bracket, with a base price of $312,500. "He is an invaluable asset and a prize pick, there is no debate about that," Delhi Daredevils chief executive Hemant Dua told AFP.    - Chris Gayle (West Indies) -    Chris Gayle has played for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL). (PTI )  A top choice for any T20 team around the world, Chris Gayle is again expected to be at the centre of a bidding war among IPL franchises. The explosive West Indies opener was not retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore for the new season, giving other teams a chance to bag him. The left-hander, who has scored tons in almost every T20 league across the world, leads a West Indies contingent also featuring Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard. The self-proclaimed 'Universe Boss' was brought in as a replacement for Dirk Nannes in the 2011 edition and has since become one of the most powerful IPL performers.  - Mitchell Starc (Australia) -  The fastest bowler in Test cricket has already put his searing deliveries to good use in the IPL, even though the pitches normally favour slow bowlers and batsmen. Starc made his presence felt in 2014 and 2015 with Royal Challengers Bangalore, Starc missed 2016 through injury and then decided not to come to India last year. Starc will challenge Steve Smith and David Warner -- who were retained by their teams for $1.9 m each -- to become Australia's highest-paid IPL player.   - Rashid Khan (Afghanistan) -  Afghanistan's rise as a cricketing nation has been synonymous with the success of sensational leg-spinner Rashid Khan. The teenager became an overnight star in his war-ravaged country last year when was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for $625,000. Khan justified the price by taking 17 wickets in 14 matches at an impressive economy rate of 6.6 per over. Khan, who was named associate nation player of the year by the International Cricket Council, could be headed for another big pay day in a year when Afghanistan are slated to play their first-ever Test -- against India in Bangalore in June, just after the IPL finishes.  - Prithvi Shaw (India) -  Crowded among India's big stars, under-19 national captain Prithvi Shaw could be the bargain pick of the auction. Put in the uncapped player category with a starting price of $3,125, the prolific batsman from Mumbai is being compared to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar. "Prithvi Shaw has only just turned 18, but already has more cricket experience than many aspiring young players will have in their whole career," said a recent ICC tweet.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/business+world-epaper-bizworld/it+s+not+about+what+you+build+it+s+about+what+people+need+says+ajay+sakhamuri+myclassboard-newsid-68845112| Startups 'It's not About What You Build, It's About What People Need' Says Ajay Sakhamuri, MyClassboard | Technology and Education go hand-in-hand these days and educational technology can not be seen as a separate entity or two different terminologies, rather an inseparable combination believes Mr. Ajay Sakhamuri, the young entrepreneur, who has been formulating ways to transform education through technology. The manifestation of technology in the present era is apparent says, Ajay, recollecting the old days of how and when the seed was planted in his heart to build a technological product for schools. It was in 2007 when Ajay who was in his final year of graduation undertook a project on "Campus Express - An online onboarding site for all students at Penn," was the thought conceived to build a software for schools. Motivated by his father to work on the project, who himself was a business professional, influenced Ajay to dig deep into the technology. However, the project could not sustain due to lack of revenue clarity. Meanwhile, Ajay got recruited for Deloitte Company as a part of campus placements before he could finish his B.Tech. He joined Deloitte as an SAP ABAP consultant and worked there for almost 2 years.  With the seed still alive in him to build a school product, Ajay during his tenure in Deloitte, correlated the SAP technology to the educational stream. When SAP can help large businesses in growing by giving a global exposure, why not schools be enlightened with the same formula? This strong conception further persuaded the young entrepreneur to perform a market analysis on schools that are using technology. The outcome was that not many schools were into technology, and if any, they were using only excel sheets. The aftermath revealed that when using technology in schools there was a huge scope for technology infused products in the educational sector. Initially, there was Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model for schools to curb the need, despite which, schools were using offline methods. Ajay was strongly convinced that there was a dire need to solve the problem in the educational space and there was no key player to work on the same lines and develop a product that illuminates the schools. This triggered the determination in Ajay and he felt it was a good opportunity to think of the same in the vertical and bring out a solution becoming the first in the market to develop a school software. "It's not about what you build, it's about what people need," says the entrepreneur while speaking about the impact of technology in an Educational realm and the obligation for a school software. Continuing further, he says, the reminiscing history of Indian Education system has seen a gigantic transformation over the past decades. Starting with the ancient Educational system comprising the Gurukula system of education to the modern education system, the education system in India had witnessed a revolution. Stressing on the technological transformation in the educational sector, Ajay says, "India has become the second largest market for e-learning after the US. This depicts the changing face of education in India with technology becoming the most important ingredient in the field of education." The enthusiastic entrepreneur set out on a mission to build a product for schools that would pull them out from the intricacies involved in the school chores and also contribute to the technological development and educational metamorphism. The initial 2-3 years was focused on product development. After a series of strenuous efforts and unceasing groundwork from the Resource and Development team for two valuable years, the MyClassboard school management software product was carved out. During the construction phase, the team managed to build a strong product by cracking large school chains. Good marketing efforts and working with reputed school chains formed the basis to develop MyClassboard by giving it a frame. In 2009, MyClassboard stepped out of the ring to exhibit its product by offering a free pilot project in those selected large chains of schools. The bold step finally did pay off receiving valuable feedback from the associates following which the R&D team scrutinized the series of feedback collected, worked on them and further implemented the necessary changes and developed the product into a complete software. Only after that, Ajay shifted his focus to scaling product and schools. MyClassboard was now a finished product that attracted the eye of many. It did captivate the pilot clients to try the engineered software and become serious clients to MyClassboard. "This was the first and major step to our success path where our clients elated by our product services referred us to their peers," says Ajay. "Our pilot team then took our product to all those referred schools and no sooner they too became our clients by embracing our product." In a very short span of time, MyClassboard could make 100 clients only through a reference from its existing clients. The journey of MyClassboard towards a successful beginning started then by exposing the product to all schools across the nation starting with Hyderabad, Bangalore, North India, and North-East. It has been 8 years since MyClassboard began its steps towards the field of education and now here it stands with head held high in a business relationship with more than 1200 schools, benefiting over 9 lakh students through its value added services. Enabling its services to all schools, MyClassboard walked an extra mile by making its modules available as per the requirements of schools. The module-wise sales have put MyClassboard in the limelight. When many start-up companies or organizations struggle to make their survival during the initial phases, MyClassboard not only survived the competition but also made its existence known by setting up a province for itself in the market and becoming India's most widely used software. For all those willing to have a foretaste of the software, MyClassboard entertains them as well with a free trial service encouraging prospective clients to discern its unique services from others in the market. Making technology as the hub, MyClassboard has been constantly upgrading its software in tune with the emerging technologies to meet the global standards. Every year, MyClassboard has come up with a new version of the product making it user-friendly and perfectly feasible. Slowly yet consistently, MyClassboard could make a stand in the market simultaneously expanding its territory to Middle-Eastern countries as well. MyClassboard offers modules that every institution needs like Admissions module, Gradebook, Parent Teacher communicator, Attendance Tracker, Reporting Tool, Transport management application, Fee management application and many other feature rich modules. Apart from efficiently managing the school operations of all departments, MyClassboard goes much beyond than just being a school management software. It offers a suite of solutions that helps the school administrators in running the school efficiently and hassle-free. Ajay's MyClassboard has made a phenomenal progress since its birth in the field of education and has been equipping schools to reach their desired haven. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 12 Jun, 12.07 pm

Led by Akhileshwar Das Maharaj, the religious leaders had urged him to end his fast.  Togadia quit the Vishwa Hindu Parishad last week after his nominee lost a key organisational election. He had sat on fast on Tuesday to press his demands such as construction of Ram temple, deportation of illegal Bangladeshis, resettlement of Hindus in Kashmir, and abolition of Article 370 of the Constitution. Speaking to reporters, Togadia took a swipe at the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying they have proved to be "as bad as their predecessors" and failed to fulfil their promises. He said he would undertake a nationwide tour to take up the issues of "100 crore Hindus" and seek to revive "Hindutva politics" as the BJP government has failed to solve the problems facing the country. "People are now asking whom they should vote for, as those who gained power in 2014 proved to be as bad as those who were ousted. So I will try to establish Hindutva politics in 2019 to realise people's aspirations," Togadia said. "I will continue raising the voice of 100 crore Hindus by embarking on a pan-India tour from tomorrow. I will also take up the issues of farmers, labourers and the youth. I am sure that the Hindus, along with workers of the RSS, BJP and VHP, are still with me in my endeavour," he said. "Narendra bhai, you need to answer why promises were not fulfilled. If you don't answer, then 100 crore Hindus along with farmers and youths will seek answer from you in 2019. Instead of roaming around the world, try to solve the problems of the people of this county," he said. Togadia quit the VHP after his nominee Raghav Reddy was defeated by former Himachal Pradesh governor V S Kokje in an election for the post of VHP's international president.

Ltd, which owns online insurance platform Coverfox, has raised $22 million in a Series C funding round led by International Finance Corp. (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank Group, and existing investor Transamerica. Other investors including SAIF partners, Accel and N.R. Narayana Murthy's Catamaran Ventures also participated in the current round. Earlier in 2015, Coverfox had raised $12 million in its Series B round, and earlier in 2011, $2 million in its Series A round.Coverfox will use the fresh investment to expand its geographical coverage across more Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and specifically address women's needs. According to its estimates, insurance penetration in rural India is 35% lower than urban areas in India, while women's insurance coverage is 40% lower than men. Coverfox aggregates insurance products offered by banking and other financial institutions on its platform. Users can compare, discover, and apply for plans online without the need of burdening paperwork.Founded in 2013 by Devendra Rane, Coverfox has integrated with more than 35 insurers and offers more than 150 policies across motor, life and health insurance. Premanshu Singh, chief executive officer of Coverfox told Mint that in terms of number of policies, motor insurance contributes to 85% of its portfolio.Apart from offering insurance products, the firm also handles insurance claims and settlements through its platform. Till date, Coverfox has processed 11,000 claims across all three insurance segments it operates in. On an average, it processes 400 claims per month."In our motor insurance category, we provide a claim facility online, which is available in all major cities in India. We have tied up with a network of garages to help customers in vehicle repairs, and we have also set-up a hotline with all our insurers so that our users can directly settle claims with us instead of settling it with insurers," Singh over the phone. According to Jun Zhang, IFC country head for India, India has one of the most underpenetrated insurance markets, with low penetration rates for women and rural populations. "By investing in Coverfox, IFC is giving a push to the country's digitization agenda by leveraging technology to deliver insurance products to customers outside metros and to women who are currently underserved," said Zhang in a statement. Coverfox competes with other online portals like Digit Insurance which was backed by Fairfax Financial Holdings in June 2017, and Policybazaar which raised money from Tiger Global, Premji Invest and others. Digital payments firm Paytm which claims to have 300 million users, also floated two new insurance units in February to offer non-life and general insurance products. Mint reported recently that Paytm will launch a separate app to offer insurance products under its brand name.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 4.56 am5 days ago5 days ago4 weeks agoa week ago2 days ago

However, these days we are getting to see more and more creatures that are very loyal and friendly to their masters, trainers or instructors. There is a fascinating video of a Gorilla doing the rounds on Facebook. It is seen sharing a great bond with the trainer. The gorilla matches and imitates every move that its instructor is doing. As per video info, it was at Florida's amusement park - Busch Gardens Tampa Bay.

April 2018 The adorable gorilla shows it imitating all the hand moves, movements and even doing some stretching exercise like standing on hands, etc. in the video that went viral on social media. This shows the trust and loyalty they have for their trainers in most animals. They share a special trusting bond with their instructors. The video caption post read: "Take a look at this progression of enrichment moments with Bolingo and animal care specialist, Rachel!

There were many lines and re - captions on the post as well as comments that followed. Some wrote "I cannot express how impressed I am with this." Then another user commented "I need to get back there! I miss spending time sitting there and interacting with them!" In the times of this world where there is war, competition, and so many crimes, these living creatures teach us a lot. While people tend to imitate & 'ape' each other as mimicry, or to make humor at somebody, sometimes it would be good to imitate these sort of animals. Humans must start learning from the animals about loyalty and friendship. Other than the fact that animals cannot speak out, they are amazing creatures if bred and trained well. It would be great and the world would be a much better place if only people would love and trust each other just like the Gorilla did for the trainer. If you show love to anybody or any creature the love will come back to you. Bolingo taught many of us something important today! Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 15 Apr, 4.27 pm

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/telangana+today-epaper-telantod/two+new+flyovers+for+hyderabad+s+old+city-newsid-80736521| Hyderabad Two new flyovers for Hyderabad's old city |  Hyderabad: Putting its focus on streamlining the traffic and ensuring smooth vehicular movement in old city, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has decided to construct two new flyovers - one from Aramgarh to Zoo Park and second, from Nalgonda crossroads to Owaisi junction. The two flyovers are to be taken up under Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP). These two routes fall under the high traffic zone category and dotted with residential clusters as well as commercial establishments, are beehive of activity for most part of the day and till late in the night. The prevailing traffic chaos on the route which often resulted in accidents, small and big, the local residents have been demanding measures to smoothen the vehicular movement.   Also read   GHMC plans to construct three steel flyovers in Hyderabad    Accordingly, the municipal corporation has roped in consultants to study the conditions on both road stretches and prepare a report along with recommendations on feasible alternative. With several religious structures located all along the routes and scarce availability of road space, the consultants have recommended flyovers here, said a senior official from GHMC. In its report submitted to the civic body, the STUP Consultants recommended a four-lane flyover from Nalgonda crossroads till Owaisi Junction and the cost of the project has been estaimated to be around Rs 523 crore. This road stretch has several bottlenecks and taking up road widening was ruled out due to the presence of religious structures, graveyards and others all through via Chanchalguda, Saidabad and Santosh Nagar. The proposed four-lane flyover will cover a distance of about five km. The estimated cost of the flyover also includes land acquisition and few other structures that need to be dismantled, besides taking up miscellaneous works. Similarly, the Aramgarh to Zoo Park route is also on a high traffic zone and the present four-lane and two-lane roads on the route were found to be not able in ensuring free flow of traffic. For this road stretch, the CE Testing company submitted its report recommending a six-lane flyover from Aramgarh to Zoo Park. Given the National Police Academy and Miralam Tank boundary, road widening was not found to be a feasible option and as part of the flyover construction, a few structures were identified for removal. The total cost of the flyover is estimated to be about Rs 636 crore. The municipal corporation would be placing both the proposals before the standing committee for approval. Once the standing committee gives its nod, administrative sanction would be sought from the State government, said the official. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 29 Jan, 12.00 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/mykhel-epaper-mykhel/liverpool+target+real+madrid+legend+casillas-newsid-85332902| Football Controversies Liverpool target Real Madrid legend Casillas | Bengaluru, April 9: Liverpool's search for a new goalkeeper has seen them linked with a shock move for Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas who is currently plying his trade at FC Porto in Portugal. The veteran stopper, 36, will be available on a free transfer at the end of the season when his contract at Porto expires. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is understood to be keen on signing competition for current number one Loris Karius. Liverpool have been extensively linked with a world-record approach for Roma's Alisson but it is understood the Anfield club are likely to turn their attentions elsewhere and that is mostly due to Karius' impressive display under the bar on a regular basis since he was awarded to start a run of games in succession.  The German has been impressive week in week out and that is why Liverpool are believed to be shifting their attention away from Alisson whose arrival would mean that Karius will be the second choice once again which would be harsh on him. Casillas, however, is at the dusk of his career and would bring a lot of experience if he moves to Anfield and can also help Loris Karius and Danny Ward to improve with his experience at the highest level. The Spanish legend could have more lucrative offers from China and America, but he is said to prefer staying in a more competitive European league. The Spaniard joined Porto in 2015 after a 25-year association with Real which began aged nine in 1990. Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp insists Emre Can's future remains 'open' and he has 'no problem' with the situation after joking the German international asked for £250,000-a week. The midfielder took to social media this week, seemingly in response to reports the contract stand off between player and club hinges on his demands for a £200,000-a-week deal. Can will be free to walk from Anfield on a Bosman at the end of the season, but Klopp believes nothing has been decided.

The cash crunch continued on Wednesday too despite the government's assurances that the situation is 'improving'. However, there is little clarity about the reasons behind ATMs drying up leading to various speculations. On Tuesday, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said there was 'more than adequate' currency in circulation and the temporary shortage in certain states was being 'tackled quickly'. 'Overall, there is more than the adequate currency in circulation and also available with banks. The temporary shortage caused by the 'sudden and unusual increase' (in demand) in some areas is being tackled quickly,' he assured.  The finance minister's assurance did not help much as fear of living without cash in the coming days badly haunted people. In the entire situation, the most troubling part for everyone was that the government did not give any specific reason for the sudden drying up of ATMs. On Wednesday, a Twitter thread by data cruncher from Kerala, James Wilson, highlighted various reasons behind the cash crunch. 'As Government and RBI now endorsed that there is a #CashCrunch, many theories are floating in the air about the reasons for the same. @scroll_in published 15 theories about why we are facing a cash crunch now. So let me float my own theory and examine some of the theories too!' tweeted Wilson. 'One of the theories is that there is an unprecedented spur in withdrawal of the money from the banks. Also people refuse to deposit money in the banks. Many factors are attributed for this theory; starting from the scary FDRI bill to Chota Modi Scams to Minimum balance looting,' Wilson wrote.  Then he examined whether there was an unprecedented withdrawal from the banks in the last couple of months. However, Wilson did not find any such rise in withdrawal based on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data. Wilson in his tweet also examined currency in circulation versus nominal GDP data--the most important factor, which governs how much currency is needed in the system. He also shared a conspiracy theory behind the cash crunch. To understand the reasons behind cash crunch, go through the entire Twitter thread well. It is not only full of facts and figures but is written in a simple and lucid manner for a layman. source: oneindia.com  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 9.37 am2 days ago2 days ago2 days ago3 days ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/youngisthan-epaper-youngeng/12+reasons+why+girls+dump+boys-newsid-77072648| Relationships 12 Reasons Why Girls Dump Boys | Reasons girls dump boys - Are you in a relationship and spend most of the time to please her? If yes, then this is a sign that you might get dumped by the girlfriend. So, stop taking things for granted and be a responsible person. The girls expect a little more than usual. But, that doesn't allow you to be calm all the time. In fact, the girls dump boys who are less involved in the relationship. Thus, pull up your socks and get ready to be there for her whenever she needs. This caring attitude towards the girlfriend will make her feel secure. Wait. Because this one gesture won't you secure in the relationship. There are many other reasons girls dump boys.  According to the survey published in the Men's Health magazine, 54 percent of the women take a week's time to decide about dumping the boyfriend. This clearly shows that moving out of a relationship is not as easy as it looks. Thus, try to be an active boyfriend rather than being an excuse-giver all the time.  Reasons Girls Dump Boys    1 - For Not Making Eye Contact  This is the first and the foremost reason why girls dump boys. The eye contact is the best way to make love. In fact, you should always look into her eyes during the conversations. As this gesture makes her feel loved and cared. But, that doesn't allow you to stare her. The continuous staring can make her feel uncomfortable and annoyed sometimes. So, fall in love with your girlfriend during the conversations and keep the relationship going.     2 - Not Being Attentive   The girlfriends expect you to be a good listener. But, your involvement with the phone more than her is not a good habit. This activity makes her feel less important. Thus, she feels like you are not on her priority list and gets enough reason to call off the relationship.     3 - Being Careless  Having a caring partner is a common expectation. But, not being by her side when she is emotionally weak shows how careless you are. This reflection of your personality disheartens her. So, be cautious and get involved in her life when she needs you the most. As a genuinely loving partner is the one who stands with you during the tough times. Therefore, the careless attitude of a boyfriend is one reason why girls dump boys.     4 - Making Excuses Always  The relationship works on the basis of trust and love. Thus, giving excuses for not making up for a party or any other occasion can make her really upset. Also, canceling the planned vacations or a dinner date with an unreal excuse is the worst thing to do in a relationship. As this makes your girlfriend feel like you are not interested in being committed. This is one of the top reasons why girls dump boys.     5 - Your Busy Work Schedule  Every relationship needs time and your indulgence in work is not allowing this to happen. Thus, your girlfriend is likely to feel ignored and sidelined. Remember, the girls never like to be less prioritized. As a result, she raises the bar and goes for another guy. So, balance your work and love life. As too much of indulgence in work is one reason why girls dump boys.     6 - No Future Planning  The future planning makes a girl feel secure and important. But, your idea to enjoy life as it comes can disappoint her. Also, she may feel like you are not sure about continuing this relationship. Thus, she takes a call and leaves you. Your idea of living the moment is likely to ruin the relationship. The zero future planning is a reason why girls dump boys often.     7 - Giving Advice More Often  You must have a say in the relationship. But, offering pieces of advice on how to deal with situations such as work stress, family issue or about relaxing can annoy her. Also, this makes you look super-intelligent and portrays her as dumb. So, stop being the advisor.     8 - Messaging Text Instead of Calling  There are a number of messaging apps available today. But, this doesn't mean you should stop calling your girlfriend. Make a couple of calls to her in a day rather than texting her all the time. A ringing cell phone grabs more attention than a message tone. As a result, she replies in time but leaving a message can make you wait. This ignites misunderstanding that result in a fight. Thus, stop texting and start calling her. The use of messaging app too much is a reason why girls dump boys.     9 - Being Unhygienic  Do get a hair and nails cut every week. Also, make sure that your socks don't stink. In fact, no girl wants to be with an unhygienic person. This is also a reason why girls dump boys.     10 - Stop Doing Me and Only Me  The girls never like to be overshadowed. Thus, stop saying I am this and that. As these things reflect how selfish you are. Also, it shows that the girl only has looks and no brain. So, stop making her feel like a zero else be ready to get dumped.     11 - Don't Be Too Aggressive  The aggressive nature can cost you the relationship. As getting into a fight anytime is something your girl will not appreciate. Also, it grabs unnecessary attention which makes her uncomfortable. So, stop being rude else you will be listed as a guy dumped by a girl.     12 - Don't Digging Her Past  Never make her feel the pain from the past. The girls prefer to be happy with the present. Thus, digging her past is a disrespectful activity. Also, this describes your mindset and thought process. So, be cautious with what you say. This is because you might not know the real reasons for her breakup from the past. Therefore, this activity can make her ditch you. Reasons girls dump boys - All these reasons are enough to understand what not to do in a relationship. So, stay humble, caring and loving towards your girlfriend. This will save you from being dumped by a girl. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 27 Nov, 10.38 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/fifa+plans+to+revamp+club+world+cup+scrap+confederations+cup-newsid-85992943| Football FIFA plans to revamp Club World Cup, scrap Confederations Cup | FIFA has laid out plans to replace the Confederations Cup with an expanded Club World Cup that will only be held every four years from 2021, a source told AFP on Wednesday. According to a letter Gianni Infantino, the president of world football's governing body, sent to the heads of the continental confederations, the Confederations Cup will cease while the club tournament will no longer be played annually in December. It will now be held every fourth June in the year before a World Cup -- just as the Confederations Cup was. Last summer's Confederations Cup in Russia -- won by Germany -- will be the last.  The new format means the club competition will interfere less with the rest of the football calendar, particularly in Europe. FIFA also faces the problem that while its principal tournament, the World Cup, is immensely lucrative and popular, neither the Confederations Cup nor the Club World Cup have been remotely as attractive to fans or sponsors. Clubs from the six confederations take part in the Club World Cup, but the gulf in quality can be embarrassingly large and only sides from Europe or South America have ever won it. Although Brazilian sides claimed the first three editions, only one of the last 11 has not been won by a European team -- inaugural winners in 2000, Corinthians triumphed for the second time in 2012. In the United Arab Emirates in December, Real Madrid became the first club to retain the trophy when they beat Brazilians Gremio Porto Alegre 1-0 with a goal by Cristiano Ronaldo.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+indian+economist-epaper-indecono/a+man+s+perspective+on+women+empowerment-newsid-80370985| Recent Articles A man's perspective on women empowerment |  By Moin Qazi  In an ashram perched high up on a hill above the city of Guwahati is a small exhibit commemorating the life of India's most famous son. Alongside a bed where Mahatma Gandhi himself slept is a display reminding visitors of something the man himself said in 1921: "Of all the evils for which man has made himself responsible, none is so degrading, so shocking or so brutal as his abuse of the better half of humanity; the female sex (not the weaker sex)."  The 21st century poses many challenges that require new ways of thinking, but none is more important than the economic role of women in a rapidly changing world. Over the last several decades, it has become accepted wisdom that improving the status of women is one of the most critical levers for addressing poverty. A series of studies have found that when women hold assets or gain incomes, family money is more likely to be spent on nutrition, medicine and housing. As a consequence, children are bound to be healthier. Societies that invest in and empower women are in a virtuous cycle. They become richer, more stable, better governed and less prone to violence.  Gender inequality: An economic challenge Gender inequality is not only a pressing moral and social issue but also a critical economic challenge. A nation cannot have sustained economic prosperity and well-being until the women's central role is recognised and their economic health is used as a measure to shape policy. It is plain logic. The human race is like a bird and as we all know, it needs both wings to be able to fly. Similarly, the human race cannot survive by only giving importance to one gender and degrading the other. In the 'Argumentative Indian', Amartya Sen mentions six prevailing inequalities in the realm of gender: Survival inequality as seen in the adverse female-male ratio against the biological reality; natality inequality in terms of sex-specific abortion; ownership inequality; unequal facilities in education, healthcare; unequal sharing of household benefits and division of labour within the household; and domestic violence and victimisation. Girls are often valued less than boys. When families fall on hard times, girls are often the first ones to be pulled out of a school to dedicate their time to wage-earning activities and are fed less frequently. Whether or not they are able to attend school, they are also burdened with household chores and have little or no time to spend with peers, leaving them isolated and overworked. In India for example, girls are less likely to be vaccinated than boys and are taken to the hospital only when they are very sick. A result is that girls in India from one to five years of age are 50 percent more likely to die than boys of the same age. Therefore, by improving girls' and women's access to basic resources such as land, water, sanitation and clean energy, they too can be healthier, wealthier, safer and better educated. It has been found that aid has often been most effective when aimed at women and girls; when policymakers do the math, they often find that these investments have a net economic return. Global outlook on gender inequality and discrimination In 2015, the world leaders put gender equality and empowerment of girls and women squarely at the top of international and development agendas. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed upon by world leaders, raised global ambition levels and added fuel to the momentum that has been building over the last decade to achieve major improvements for the people, the entire planet and not in the least the world's women. This is seen not only as important in its own right, but also as an essential ingredient to eradicate poverty. The general perception has been that gender mainstreaming is not seen as a priority of humanitarian response. It becomes an add-on and not a primary concern when in reality, it should be an essential component of social programmes. From poor education to poor nutrition to vulnerability and low pay employment, the number of discriminatory acts that a woman may suffer during her lifetime is simply beyond acceptable. Improvement in access to quality education for girls can boost their future income, reduce rates of child malnutrition and reduce overall poverty levels. For all interventions, the fundamental logic is plain: If the world is going to end extreme poverty, then it needs to start with girls and women. Discrimination against the female race is a long-running and pervasive phenomenon in every stratum of the Indian society. India's progress towards gender equality, measured by its position in the rankings such as the Gender Development Index has been disappointing, despite fairly rapid rates of economic growth. A culturally ingrained parental preference for sons, emanating from their importance as caregivers in old age is linked to poor consequences for the daughters. Role of men in uplifting the status of women One unique policy experiment at the village-level governance, which mandated representation of women in one-third of all positions of local leadership has shown promising results. While increasing representation of women in the public spheres is important and can potentially be attained through some form of an affirmative action and an attitudinal shift, it is essential for women to be considered as equals in their homes and in society at large. However, the path to achieving gender parity is not an easy one. To make women empowerment sustainable, we have to move beyond programmes that are exclusively focused on women and involve the men as they are a critical piece of the empowerment ecosystem. We often talk about the need for men to alter themselves in order to understand and respect the differences they share with their female halves. However, we rarely offer them concrete support to handle issues of patriarchy and masculinity. The fact is that if we want the ecosystem of power to change around women, society needs to ensure that men are happy, healthy and supportive partners to women. Female empowerment programmes must have a cultural sensitisation lens for local men and traditional leaders. Policy engagement must be a part of a transformative approach to ensure that positive changes on the ground are embodied in policy frameworks for scaling them so that they are sustainable in the long run. Investments have to be boosted in labour-saving technologies such as fuel-efficient stoves and processing machines to save women from spending most of their time on domestic chores. Error in the historic perception of women The development language has become saturated with paternalistic overtones. The gender discourse instructs us that women are meant to be pitied and they are not to be seen as drivers of human history. They are seen as reproductive, not generative-merely reproducing the world but not making new worlds. Empowerment has many dimensions: Social, economic, cultural, political and personal. When every part is treasured, the good unleashed is the greatest. Men may fret that they lose when women win, but history tells us that when women advance, humanity advances. This lesson is best embodied in the words of Nirmala, a self-help group member for well over two decades and the current sarpanch of Wanoja in Central India, which she keeps repeating whenever I visit her: "My father always believed that it would have been far better if I were born a son, but today he realizes how lucky he is to have me as a daughter."

However, doctors have made some shocking revelations against the herbal powder. They say that the ingredients can primarily cause infertility. Nilavembu is considered a 'Siddha drug' (traditional medicine originating in ancient Tamilakam in South India) and is prescribed to cure all fevers, including dengue.  "It is a matter of concern when studies are contradictory," said Indian Medical Association state president Dr T N Ravishankar to the Times of India .   What is nilavembu?   Nilavembu is a poly herbal formula that controls fever in a comprehensive way through its healing effects of temperature regulation, inflammation control and body pain relief. It exhibits potent antiviral activity against viruses causing Dengue and Chikungunya fever. The powder's main ingredients are: Two or three teaspoons of the powder is mixed in water and set to boil. It forms a decoction which is taken twice on empty stomach.  Side-effects  Nilavembu becomes a cause of infertility when the powder is consumed in its raw form, said Dr Selvin Innocent Dhas, president of the Indian Siddha Medical Graduates Association. It also causes problems in its decoction form for women. "If you give the decoction to pregnant women or people with stomach ulcers, acidity or digestive problems, it can trigger vomiting. In severe dengue, where patients are already dehydrated, this medicine can be deadly," he told the Times of India. "It's an herbal medicine that should not be used indiscriminately," he further added. The Tamil Nadu government had decided to provide nilavembu free of cost to all eateries through the designated officers of the food safety department in every district, such was their belief on the positive effects of the siddha drug. However, a five-member committee sent to the state by the Centre to investigate the outbreak of dengue said they would not recommend mass administration of nilavembu. "There is no proven, clinically useful anti-viral component effective against dengue," told Dr Dilip Mathai, dean and professor of medicine at Apollo Institute of Medical Science and Research to the Times of India. "If the government is asking doctors to give herbs with a promise of helping patients, it will be unethical and illegal," he said. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 17 Oct, 2.43 pm

According to News18 Tamil Nadu which broke the story, the WhatsApp conversation between Nirmala Devi, a mathematics professor and a woman student has been entered as evidence in the case. The alleged conversation between the student and Nirmala Devi took place between March 2 and 16. The conversation shows the desperate attempt by the professor to allegedly lure these students into sex work. While Nirmala Devi is not explicit about the 'opportunity' that she has for the students, she allegedly harasses them by asking them to change their display pictures and even telling them to eat eggs.  On March 2, she messages the student asking, "Darlings, can we form a team? When madam goes out, do you want to come with me? Can we quietly achieve (this)?" While some of the details of the conversation have been blurred, she goes on to allegedly lure them further, giving them 'nuggets' of wisdom. "U all very well known abt the competitions to survive in this world with SUCCESS with money and fame. It needs not only talents but some intelectual movement both mentally and physicaly. U r so brilliant in my view, u may 75% realise wt i am going to tell(sic)," reads one message. Once again, Nirmala Devi is careful not to be make her 'offer' explicit.    Using one student as a messenger, the professor goes on to write, "..u 6 all talented and u all will be appreciated by the society and it will lead good will. Pls convey and discuss it. I think u may understand. If ok pls ask them to send me good morning and good evening msgs in capital letters daily... After that only i will spoke with the reliable one. If u r not willing definetly u all miss the good opportunity (sic)."    Explaining that she is empathetic to the situation she is putting them in, Nirmala says, "Moreover i am also having two girl children like u, so i will think think a lot in all the matters I am going to execute my plan next week by the help of (accomplice name blacked out) and (accomplice name blacked out) first (sic)." In yet another message urging the students to maintain secrecy, she then says, "then (student name), u and (student name) eat egg per my request In academically as well as THICK friendship level... I will GUIDE u in academicaly and financially...Also in career.. How much u keep the secret that much u will be appreciated by all (sic)" Nirmala Devi goes on to ask for another student's number and then asks all the students to change their display picture on WhatsApp. "Pls change all of ur dp's with ur's SUPER(individual) photos (Student name) sending gm msg (sic)," she says.    Slamming the professor for her inappropriate behaviour, the student replies, "Ma'am I didn't expect this. This will not work out for my family and me. So please don't discuss this anymore. Hope you understand." To this, Nirmala Devi replies, "Opportunities coming then only I am suggesting, asking. Think. Think. Think." In Tamil, she continues, "When luck knocks on your door, you must use it. Luck will come only once in a while." To this, the student categorically replies saying it is a sin. In a seemingly understanding tone, Nirmala Devi says, "Ok ma. Take ur way. Sorry da (sic)." The student adds, "This is not luck and don't repeat it. What do you think? I am not worrying." Giving the professor a piece of her mind, the student says, "Please don't go and ask another girl all this. I am repulsed just by listening to this. It doesn't matter what you think. If someone else had asked what you just asked me, the outcome would have been very different. I respect your age and position so I am going silently. Don't think that just because I am silent, that you are correct. Don't speak to anyone like this. If you speak to me like this again, the outcome will be different." Undeterred by the clear rejection of her offer, the professor says, "A small but strong ladder is before my eyes. That's why I suggested this (sic)." Once again, the student says she is not interested. Claiming that the others involved would be careful about 'security', Nirmala writes, "From what they have tested me so far, I know they are very very careful about security. That's why I decided to talk about this now." The professor continues to badger the student, telling her more than twice to "think". Seemingly appreciating the students for their stance while also allegedly trying to recruit them to go along with her ideas, she says, "I read ur msg. Good. I was also said once upon time like u. But situation changes. If we are not there, it doesn't mean it won't happen. I have missed many opportunities. I thought this was like that. If you don't want, leave it. I will tell them. That's all. They will look for someone else. On March 16, the professor once again continues to message the student despite repeated rejection. She writes, "Darlings you are really missing very very very good opportunities (sic)." Dropping another bombshell that begs the question of who she was working for, she asks the students what they thought about the position of registrar and collector. She also clarifies that she was not referring to a "bill collector." Anticipating their "fears" even after the student refused her, she says, "U think abt the security? how they think the security? Security is more more more. I always suggest u all, the best ones (sic)." At this point, Nirmala Devi promises to leave the student alone, saying, "Ok da leave it. Sorry. I won't disturb u. Believe me. Believe me. Believe me (sic)." Outraged by her incessant badgering, the student shoots back, "How dare you ask me like this?" Nirmala Devi doesn't reply. The professor was arrested on Monday even as a one-man investigation has been launched into the matter directly overseen by Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit.

One of the most stinging observations that were made by the court was when it said that courts are not a place to settle business or political scores. Here are the top observations of the court:  No probe into the death of judge B H Loya The PIL had no truth in it and was an attempt to malign the judiciary. Judge had died a natural death and there was not a shred of doubt about it. The judicial process should not be governed by fear of contempt. The judicial process is based on the moral authority of courts. Petitioners' advocates Dushyant Dave, Indira Jaising and Prashant Bhushan launched a frontal attack on the judiciary by telling SC to disbelieve three judicial officers who accompanied Loya to Nagpur, stayed with him at a guest house and said Loya died of a heart attack. During the arguments, counsels did not maintain institutional civility towards the judges of the SC and made wild allegations. It would have been ideal to initiate contempt proceedings against the petitioners in such a case where a political rivalry is brought to the court to malign the judiciary. PILs were meant to provide succour to the downtrodden and voiceless but now have become an industry to settle business and political rivalry.  PILs dismissed while quoting the following material facts. Indisputable statements of judicial officers. Nothing wrong with friends and colleagues sharing same room at Ravi Bhawan. Loya called his wife on Nov 30, said he was staying at Ravi Bhawan.  source: oneindia.com  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 11.23 amyesterdayyesterdayyesterdayyesterday2 days ago

The data was collated by Reuters amid mounting public anger over crimes against women after two horrific cases in recent months that has, once again, cast a harsh light on systemic problems plaguing the country's police and courts.   The gangrape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kashmir state and the arrest of a ruling party legislator for the rape of a teenage mother in Uttar Pradesh province have sparked nationwide outrage, drawing nightmarish parallels with the gangrape and murder of a student in New Delhi six years ago.  Amid the wave of anger at that time, the government promised to speed up rape trials, provide harsher penalties, including the death sentence in extreme cases, and a law against stalking. But statistics show that since 2012, reported rape cases climbed 60 per cent to around 40,000 in 2016, with child rape accounting for about 40 per cent. The conviction rate of people arrested for rape remains stuck around 25 per cent. The backlog of rape cases pending trial stood at more than 133,000 by the end of 2016, up from about 100,000 in 2012, National Crime Records Bureau data showed. In each year during that period, about 85 per cent of the total rape cases being heard remained pending. In general, conviction rates for crime against women - deaths following demands for dowry, assault, kidnapping as well as rape - are lower than for most other crimes. "The government can make a hundred laws and yet it will fail because there is no enforcement," said Dushyant Dave, a senior lawyer at India's Supreme Court. "It needs to take this as an epidemic and treat it accordingly, by completely overhauling the police machinery, prosecutors and the judicial system."  CASES BURIED  Crime statistics showed that police files remain open for about a third of all rapes that were investigated for each year between 2012 and 2016. Understaffing is an issue. The government told Parliament in March, police had a sanctioned strength of nearly 2 million officers, but almost a quarter of those positions were vacant. Some of the worst accusations against the police stem from cases, like the ones in Uttar Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, where they are alleged to have bowed to pressure from people of influence to bury cases. Vappala Balachandran, a former top police officer in the western state of Maharashtra who has criticised the government's response to the recent cases, described how powerful local politicians stall police investigations. "The one weapon the politician has is the threat of transfer (of police officers) and which they routinely exercise. So the investigation is slow, improper and weak," Balachandran said.  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  So far the only policy response to the latest cases has come from Maneka Gandhi, the minister for women and child development, who has advocated applying the death penalty for rape cases where the victim is under 12 years old. Currently, the Supreme Court reserves the death penalty for extreme cases, as in the 2012 Delhi case. Five people were convicted of rape and murder in that case within nine months, a remarkably swift decision for India. Four were sentenced to death while a juvenile was freed after serving three years. A sixth accused hung himself in his cell before the trial concluded. In 2017, the top court rejected an appeal by the four sentenced to death but they remain on death row. A study by the National Law University in Delhi found that 43 death sentences were handed down for murder involving sexual violence in 2017, almost double the previous year's number. A study by Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, whose founder shared the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, reckoned that as of the end of 2016, the backlog of child sex abuses cases in the courts would take two decades to clear. Under India's Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act passed in 2012, which covers victims under 18 years, police should collect evidence within a month of the complaint being filed and the court should complete a trial within a year. "The government of India is doing its work sincerely in each and every case," PS Narasimha, a senior prosecutor for the federal government, told Reuters in response to a question why rape cases took so long and the conviction rates were so low. But Kohal Dev Sharma, a lawyer at the Punjab and Haryana High Court, said the Indian criminal justice system failed when it came to rape. "The procedure itself is quite lengthy that deters most victims from fighting the battle and thus the accused are set free ultimately in most of the cases," he said. "The procedure is traumatic for the victim who has to face a society that considers rape as a social stigma only for the victim and not the accused, due to which most victims choose to keep mum about what they go through rather than to report it."

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+quint-epaper-quint/did+demonetisation+change+india+s+cash+habits-newsid-86050722| Home Did Demonetisation Change India's Cash Habits? | Reports of a cash crunch in certain parts of the country have brought back some of the questions that were asked in the aftermath of demonetisation. In November 2016, when the Narendra Modi led government withdrew 86 percent of the country's currency, the hope was that the use of cash in the economy would reduce. Not only would the stock of cash, some of it accounted for, find its way into bank deposits, but the use of cash in regular transactions would also fall as customers migrated towards electronic payments.Has It Played Out That Way? And To What Extent? We Still Love Cash Currency in circulation stood at Rs 18.4 lakh crore as on 6 April 2018. In absolute terms, this is above the Rs 17.98 lakh crore in currency that existed before demonetisation. As a percentage of GDP, cash is currently at 10.8 percent of FY18 nominal GDP compared to 12 percent before demonetisation. The gap is assumed to be a change in consumer preference for cash. The Economic Survey released on 28 January, said that the cash-to-GDP ratio had stabilised at lower levels. In absolute terms, cash was lower by Rs 2.8 lakh crore or 1.8 percent of GDP, estimated the Economic Survey. However, over the last few months, the pace at which currency in circulation is growing has picked up."Analysts, for a while, had spotted a sharp rise in cash, particularly in December-January '18, a puzzling phenomenon, largely unexplained beyond the standard suspects - elections, kharif crop marketing, etc... This trend seems to have persisted in the first 2 weeks of FY19," wrote Saugato Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank in a note on Friday.Is the increased demand temporary? Or does this suggest that the preference for cash, for some reason, is moving closer to pre-demonetisation levels?It is tough to conclude that with any certainty. However, if that is indeed the case, then there may be some aggregate shortage of cash in the economy. R Gandhi, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, told BloombergQuint that based on pre-demonetisation trends, currency in circulation should have been at close to Rs 23 lakh crore compared to the Rs 18 lakh crore right now."That Rs 5 lakh crore difference is because of people having shifted from cash to bank deposits. If we assume that people have moved back to cash (that is an assumption), then there would be a shortage. But estimating that is not easy," Gandhi said.Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse also pointed out that the Rs 45,000 crore rise in currency in circulation is the lowest since 2013. As a percentage of GDP, it is lowest in nearly 10 years. Could this suggest that growth in currency is not keeping pace with the typical pick-up in demand, leading to a shortage?We're Withdrawing More From ATMsCash withdrawals at ATMs is another indicator being tracked to see whether cash habits changed after demonetisation. It may also hold clues to the recent cash crunch.Data on the value of monthly transactions at ATMs suggests that demand for cash at ATMs rebounded quickly as cash availability improved in the months after demonetisation. By October 2017, the value of ATM withdrawals had hit pre-demonetisation levels.Since then, economists point out that there have been two noteworthy trends.Soumyakanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India, points out ATM withdrawals in the second half of the fiscal saw a larger jump than normal.Soumyakanti Ghosh, chief economist at SBIDuring FY18, ATM withdrawals increased by 12.2 percent in H2 compared to H1. This growth was much higher compared to FY16 or FY15 and even the 5-year average of 8.2 percent.Could this be simply because of a pick-up in economic activity in the second half of the year? Perhaps.Bhattacharya of Axis Bank highlights another trend. There has been a drop in transaction volumes in FY18 but not in the value of transactions, implying a steep rise in the average size of transactions.Soumyakanti Ghosh, chief economist at SBIIn other words, larger amounts of cash were being drawn in FY18 at every ATM transaction. Whether this had anything to do with the larger note denominations is not knownWhile ATM withdrawals have remained strong, in recent months, the RBI has been supplying more lower denomination notes, said a senior banker speaking on condition of anonymity. This has meant that banks need to replenish ATMs more frequently, which has been a challenge, this banker said.Ghosh of SBI also pointed out that the 'velocity' of the Rs 2000 note is low. Essentially that means that it takes longer for a Rs 2000 note to return to the bank once its withdrawn. "This indicates possibly currency of higher denomination/Rs 2000 is not getting adequately circulated in the economy," said Ghosh.But We Are Also Transacting More DigitallyAs cash has come back, have consumers given up on digital transactions? Not really.RBI data on digital transactions shows that there was a jump in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation. The lack of cash availability pushed many towards digital payment options like mobile wallets.The increase has persisted even after remonetisation, the RBI said in its 'Mint Street Memo' series in November 2017. According to RBI staffers, three non-cash modes of payment picked up following demonetisation. These segments are retail electronic payments, card usage at point-of-sale terminals and cheques."The increased usage of these three instruments during the demonetisation period has been sustained in the post-demonetisation period as well, suggestive of a fundamental shift being underway in payment habits of the Indian economy," said the RBI report.Representative data on electronic payments put out by the RBI on a monthly basis does show a continued increase in the volume of transactions.Trends on the value of payments, however, are more patchy at least on a month-on-month basis. To be sure, on a year-on-year basis, value of transactions continues to be higher suggesting that the increased adoption of digital payments has been sticky.(This article was originally published in BloombergQuint.)Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 2.15 pm5 hrs agoyesterdayyesterday3 days agoyesterday

"A rape is a rape. How can we tolerate this exploitation of our daughters?"But can we compare the number of rapes in different governments? We cannot say there were this many rapes in our government and that many in yours. There cannot be a worse way to deal with this issue," he said. Calling it the evil of not just the individual but also of the society, the Prime Minister said people need to teach their sons to treat girls with respect.He said the cases of rapes was a cause of concern for the whole nation and one should remember that the one "committing the sin" is someone's son."That's why I presented this issue from the Red Fort in a new way. I had said that if a daughter comes late, parents ask where had she gone and why. Whom did she meet?"Everyone asks their daugthers, but you should also ask your sons where had they been," Modi said.The Prime Minister's remarks came as his government faced criticism for increasing incidents of rapes of minors especially after an 8-year-old girl was gang-raped and killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district.

The car has been around for literally forever now. Even though the "tall boy" hatchback is the first choice of many first-time car buyers in India, there are many enthusiast-modified versions of the same. We bring you five modified such WagonRs from India. Red Devil The simple looking WagonR has been modified with some interesting additions. The car loses its stock grille and gets an all-new black grille. The headlamps have been worked upon too and it now gets projector headlights with LED DRLs.  The blood-red colored WagonR also gets body kit with a front bumper lip. The new bumper also gets new projector fog lamps. The modified WagonR gets wider profile tyre and new spoke alloy wheels. White bride    The "blue-eyed" WagonR is in one of the most selling body colors in India and yet, it will turn a large number of heads turn. The WagonR seen here gets a number of changes like a new lower bumper, a new mesh grille at the front. The headlamps have been updated too and it gets blue angel eyes with LED DRLs. The hatchback also gets very catchy red colored alloy wheels that make for a contrasting view. The WagonR is also adorned with a blue splitter at front. The whole set-up looks quite trendy. Rough Road-friendly    WagonR has always been a smooth sailor on the tarmac. On rough roads, the car did struggle a bit. This car from Delhi has worked around the problem to make an off-road friendly WagonR. The car gets a new number and new grille. The headlamps have been upgraded to full-LED set-up too.The body of the WagonR also gets slight changes. The wheel arches have been flared to give it a SUV-ish look. Sporty    From the "Land of mods", the WagonR seen here gets very sporty outlook. To start with, the WagonR gets a huge mesh grille up front. To give it a sportier outlook, the modder has also added a "Type R" badge, which really does not belong to the Suzuki. The WagonR also gets a front splitter and deep dish alloy wheels. To make it look bold, there are embossed bold letters mentioning the Suzuki name on the bonnet too. M Power    OK, we know that M Power and Suzuki are not related in any way. What they have in common is set of four wheels and maybe enthusiastic owners. Here is a Maruti WagonR with reworked face with new mesh grille. The grille also gets iconic "M Power" badge, that truly belongs to a BMW vehicle. There is also a splitter and LED DRLs pasted just below the headlamps of the vehicle. Stingray    The Wagonr Stingray is the sportier version of the WagonR. It is on the list as an honorary mention to the Stingray. People have modified it even further to gain more eyeballs. Seen here is Stingray with an aftermarket bumper. The car also gets red and blue stripes to make it more catchy.

The Commission has now taken into account the prevailing weather conditions in large parts of the state, particularly the extreme heat during the day, and considered it necessary to extend the hours of poll to facilitate the voters to cast their votes even in the late hours.  'Accordingly, the Commission has notified that the hours of poll for the elections in entire state will be 7.00 AM to 6.00 PM, i.e. extending it by one hour in the afternoon,' an EC order said.

Meera had changed so much that it was difficult to recognise her and that's why her pictures have gone viral. Meera wore a floral saree in the event and was seen posing for the shutterbugs.  The actress celebrated her 36th birthday on February 15, by probably gifting herself some jewellery. According to reports, she will play Mohanlal's wife in the upcoming film, Neerali. There is no official confirmation on that though.     Meera rose to fame when she impressed everyone with her acting skills in her Tamil debut film Run (2002) wherein she was paired opposite actor R Madhavan. The movie became a blockbuster hit in Tamil Nadu and established her as a sought-after actress. Later, Meera went on to star in Gudumba Shankar with Pawan Kalyan. Meera has films like Bhadra, Raaraju and Gorintaku to her credit. While she did a Telugu film Akasha Ramanna, eight years ago, she is still popular with the Tollywood audience.      In 2008, the Malayalam film industry had called for a ban on Meera which was issued by the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) after she declined to shoot for a film by Dileep, Twenty:20.     However, she continued shooting for films and had said that she was not aware of the ban. Later, she got married to Anil John Titus on 9 February 2014 who works as an engineer in Dubai.

This micron, when makes an entry into the human system, can cause cancer.Professor and Head of The Department Chemistry, CMR Institute of Technology, Dr Phani Kumar Pullela said, the new journal of medicine has already made publications of the harmful impact of plastic coming into contact with humans.Food and beverage containers, some disposable plates, and toiletry bottles made of plastic have chemicals. Research suggests that all plastics may release chemicals if they're scratched or heated. Research also strongly suggests that at certain exposure levels, some of the chemicals in these products, such as Bisphenol A (BPA), may cause cancer in people. "The same concept has to be applied in cooking idli. If the idli is cooked using thin plastic, there is a high chance of suffering from diseases including cancer. The plastic residues may leak into food substance when exposed to heat. The plastic emits harmful carcinogens when food is cooked or is heated in plastic items. In the long run, people will get infected with cancer as well," said Dr Pulella.Agreeing with Dr Pullela, Dr Linge Gowda, Director of KIDWAI Memorial Institute of Oncology, says, it is beyond an iota of doubt that plastic when exposed to heat releases harmful carcinogens which cause cancer."Consumption of food cooked in aluminium, steel, earthen pot or copper is safe. We have noticed people using plastic glass to drink roadside tea, and also people eat food like idli cooked using a plastic sheet in the cookware. The hotels and roadside stalls were earlier using a cotton cloth to avoid batter getting struck to idly cooking plates, but now, the plastic sheet is being used in most of the eateries. In the long run, this will have an impact on health. Hence we suggest that the local and municipal authorities must impose penalty on such eateries," he said. Dr Nirmal Buggi, Chief Health Officer of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, has directed all the 198 health inspectors to check eateries in their respective jurisdiction and impose penalty for use of plastic in cooking. "The plastic above 40 micron and micro wave safe vessels are only allowed to cook and serve food when it comes to use of plastic. The roadside shops are aware that using such plastic in cooking and also while covering the serving plate can cause negative effects on health. Yet, they do not comply with BBMP rules," he said.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/yourstory-epaper-yourstory/appfriday+meet+loco+india+s+first+live+quiz+app+that+lets+you+earn+and+learn-newsid-81054752| Home [AppFriday] Meet Loco, India's first live quiz app that lets you earn and learn |   This real-time mobile quiz show hosted by Gaurav Kapur has been the talk of the internet universe lately. You play, they pay.    Loco, a live trivia game show app, has been buzzing on Indian Twitter lately.   Inspired by HQ Trivia - the US app started by Vine Founders Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll last August - Loco invites users to play a quiz in real-time and lets them earn "real cash" if they answer all questions correctly. The quiz takes place twice (1:30 pm and 10 pm) on weekdays, and once (10 pm) on weekends. The premise is simple: you play, they pay.   Loco (earlier known as the Showtime app) is, what many reckon, a mobile adaptation of the uber-hit TV show  Kaun Banega Crorepati,  which itself was a desi version of  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?    Like KBC, Loco employs a charismatic host (popular sports presenter Gaurav Kapur in this case), asks users 10 multiple choice questions, offers them 'lives' to come back into the game if they are eliminated, and rewards them with cash prizes (credited in their Paytm accounts). The only difference is, multiple people are playing the game simultaneously, and the prize money of Rs 12,500 gets shared among the winners.   Loco was started in November 2017 by the former marketing lead at edutech startup Unacademy. The Android version of the app went live in December, and by end-January, Loco notched up more than 120,000 installs on Google Play Store. It is one of the fastest-growing apps in India already.   Loco Founder and CEO, Abhishek Madhavan tells  YourStory  , "We are seeing 10,000 daily downloads and have close to 30,000 concurrent users now. Over 80 percent of these users have come through referrals." Loco allows users to "invite" friends with referral codes, and earn game lives when they sign up.   Loco is available in Hindi and English versions, but will soon launch in Telugu and Tamil too. The iOS version of the app will roll out as well. Abhishek says a lot of traffic is coming from smaller towns now, and he expects Loco to cross "half a million downloads" in the coming months.   HQ Trivia, in comparison, has 1.5 million daily users already. It is now among the top five gaming apps on App Store, and is an addiction for all of the United States. Abhishek is confident that formats like these are "the future of television."   We take a closer look at the Loco app.   How Loco works   Once the app is downloaded and installed, you get started by creating a username of minimum four characters. You can key in a referral code (if any). If you don't have a code, you may proceed without that.      The next page shows you a countdown to the next game, and a glimpse of your leaderboard. You start with zero balance and zero lives in your account. The counts increase as you play more games and win cash.      You can click on Settings and browse through the 'Rules' and 'How to Play' sections. You can also add your Paytm number where the cash prize gets deposited on a weekly basis. There is a 'Change Language' option too, which would be in use shortly.      One minute prior to the start of every game, the app displays the Rules on your mobile screen. You have to join the live game on time. If you're a second late, you can only watch, and not participate.      The host appears at sharp 1:30 pm and/or 10 pm, and after a brief reiteration of the game rules, he sets the quiz rolling.      The questions are based on a range of topics viz. current affairs, politics, technology, food, sports, culture, entertainment, religion, mythology, etc. The first question is a walkthrough, what host Gaurav Kapur calls a "practice ball".      After every question, Loco displays the number of users who got it right, giving a sense of how many contenders you have for the final cash prize.      The questions get tougher as the game progresses. You've ten seconds to answer each multiple-choice question. If you get it wrong or are slow to answer, you are eliminated from the game. But, you can continue to watch.   Typically, the tenth question is the toughest, and Loco mandates that users cannot use a lifeline for it. It essentially means if you get it wrong, you are eliminated, and you cannot come back into the game.      Every quiz lasts for about 15 minutes. Once all ten questions have been asked, Loco displays the list of winners, and the cash won by each. So, for instance, if Rs 12,500 is the overall prize money, and there are 50 winners, Rs 250 is credited in each of their Paytm accounts. Hence, more the players, less the money.      Issues with the app   While the quiz per se is simple and enjoyable, the app is super sluggish even on a fast internet connection. The video lags, the audio and visual are not in sync at times, and the sound is jarring.   Since all questions, answers, and your status in the game are displayed on the screen, it might be a good idea to mute the sound on your mobile device and continue playing. However, it defeats the purpose of having a popular host.  At the end of every game, a feedback page appears on the screen. You can let the developers know your issues with the app.     Loco scores as a game show, but as a live-streaming app, it leaves a lot to be desired. Founder Abhishek explains, "Hiring engineers who can crack real-time streaming has been a challenge. The pace at which we've grown the user base was also unexpected."   Players who have rated Loco on Google Play Store have even complained of abrupt eliminations. Most recently, Loco added two lives to each player's account to compensate for the glitches in the app. Abhishek says, "The percentage of people facing technical issues would be 0.1 percent. It could be because they are using Chinese phones which aren't optimised for high bandwidth video."   But, Loco assures that these niggles would be taken care of in the time to come, especially when it has investments flowing in from Pocket Aces, a digital media and entertainment firm that has acquired the app for an undisclosed amount.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/master+blaster+s+gully+cricket+adventure-newsid-85939712| Cricket Master Blaster's gully cricket adventure | Often called the God of Cricket, Sachin Tendulkar is pretty much everyone's favourite. What happens when the God of Cricket himself joins you for a game? Yes, it happened to a few lucky youngsters in Mumbai!  For these restaurant workers, a routine night of playing some cricket to unwind after work became one to remember forever when the humble Master Blaster joined them.      A screengrab from the video of Sachin playing with the youngsters  The video of the quick game, which went viral almost instantly, shows Sachin getting out of his car and shaking hands with the boys, before taking his stance in front of a plastic road divider. As he looked like he rolled the years back, Sachin played a few shots before taking selfies with them. Sameer Shaikh, the manager of the food delivery joint where the youngsters all under the age of 25 work, says, "We were wondering who this person was who parked his car in the middle of the road in such a narrow lane," he chuckles, now recounting the incident. "He was possibly clicking a selfie or making a video while in the car."    The youngsters all under the age of 25 work at a food joint  And as the car came closer, it was a rather filmy moment for the gang, who regularly play cricket to unwind after their 12-hour shifts. Salman Ahmed Syed says, "One of Sachin's friends came out from the car and told us 'There is a man who played in the Indian cricket team and now wants to play with you. Will you allow him to?' We said okay, and asked the man to call the cricketer out. We had no idea it was Sachin!"   After a quick few selfies, the cricketer departed but not without setting social media on fire with his warmth and humbleness  Another employee, Ramanuj Dhuriya adds, "Sachin was apparently going to meet his friend, but stopped when he saw us and said he'd rather play with us first!" He may have barely played four balls but the ace batsman gave the awestruck boys something to remember him by. "He spoke to us in Marathi and asked us 'ball kon pakadnar' (who will catch the ball?) He did not miss a single ball!" Sameer says with a shy smile. "He asked us what we do and we told him about our food joint." However, their moment of quick cricket was interrupted when cars stopping by realised it was indeed Sachin on the streets playing cricket, and ran towards him for pictures. A woman in the car came to a quick halt and jumped out on spotting him, screaming, "Sachin, I love you." That gathered the attention of other folks as well, causing Sachin to quickly take pictures with his 'team mates', before he zoomed off.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+health+orange-epaper-orange/rabies+vaccination+what+happens+if+you+miss+an+injection-newsid-72529363| Stay Happy Rabies Vaccination: What Happens If You Miss An Injection? | Most animal lovers know all the strays in their area and often stop to play with them - of course, playtime gets a little rough sometimes and you come away with a nip or two. It doesn't matter how well you know the dog, you still have to visit your doc for the rabies vaccine. Unlike most vaccines that only require a single shot, rabies vaccines typically require 3-5 injections. Sometimes, we get so caught up with our daily routine, that we skip our doctor's appointment.     What Happens If You Miss Just 1 Rabies Injection?    "Although it is important to stick to your vaccine schedule, a delay of 1 to 2 days is considered acceptable"  Until a couple of decades ago, getting bitten by a stray dog meant 16 anti-rabies shots injected directly into the abdomen. Luckily for us, today most rabies vaccines require just 3-5 shots depending on the type of vaccine. In the case of a  3-shot rabies vaccine , the second injection is given a week after the first and the last one is given either 2 weeks or 3 weeks from the date of the first injection.  To understand what will happen if you skip an injection, we need to take a look at how the rabies vaccine works. The rabies vaccine is made up of the dead rabies virus. When it is injected into your body, your immune system it immediately starts to produce anti-bodies to fight off the perceived infection. Multiple shots ensure that the levels of antibodies remain elevated, so that even if the live virus is already in your system, the antibodies will neutralize it.  Although it is important to stick to your vaccine schedule, a  delay of 1 to 2 days is considered acceptable  as your antibody levels will still be high enough to fight off an infection. If the delay is longer than this, you need to contact your doctor immediately so that your situation can be re-evaluated.  How Long Do Rabies Symptoms Last?   "It generally takes between 30 to 50 days for rabies symptoms to develop"  The symptoms of rabies appear once the rabies virus reaches the spinal cord or brain. It generally takes between 30 to 50 days for rabies symptoms to develop. However, in some cases, symptoms can appear in just 10 days or it could take over a year! The initial symptoms of rabies are similar to flu and the person might experience difficulty swallowing followed by fever, a headache, and vomiting.  Can Rabies Be Transmitted Through Licking?    "If any open wound or skin tear is exposed to contaminated saliva, the rabies virus can be transmitted instantly"  The rabies virus can only be transmitted if the saliva from an infected animal gets into your bloodstream. This is why the most common method of transmission is through a bite; but you can also get infected if an animal with rabies has licked its claws before scratching you. However, it is possible to get rabies if an infected animal licks you in an area where your skin is broken.  Can Rabies Be Cured?   Rabies can be prevented with a vaccine but currently there is no cure for it. If you are bitten, you should visit your doctor right away. The incubation for rabies can be as little as 5 days so don't assume that you can wait for a week to see if the animal that bit you is unwell before seeking medical attention. The chances of survival are extremely low once the patient becomes symptomatic. To date, out of the tens of thousands of people who have been infected, there are less than 10 documented cases of human survival. India's problem with stray dogs is proving to be an uphill battle against rabies. Our country records over 20,000 deaths related to rabies every year and the figures just keep rising!

Aditya Birla Group appoints first ever woman CEO for apparel company Pantaloons |  By Tanya Agarwal   After 160 years, the $41 billion company Aditya Birla Group has appointed its first ever woman Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with Pantaloons Fashion Retail appointing Ms Sangeeta Pendurkar as the CEO. They did so on 16th January 2018, in what can be labelled as a revolutionary step. She is the former Managing Director (MD) at Kellogg India. Pendurkar's background and experience make her the right candidate to be the CEO of Pantaloons. She has more than 25 years of experience in marketing products in banking, food and FMCG industry. Company background  Pantaloons began in 1997 as a Future Group company. It has constantly sought to equip the emerging Indian middle-class with an indigenous fashion retail format. Consistent with the times, the model was a discount fashion retailer. Post-acquisition by Aditya Birla Nuvo Limited in 2013, Pantaloons is the fastest growing large format retailer in the country today. It retails over 200 licensed and international brands, including 24 exclusive brands. It has been losing its presence in the competitive industry as domestic brands, e-com retailers and international brands are making their mark. There is an uncertainty about whether there will be any drastic strategic change in the company's brand positioning.  In June last year, Pendurkar had quit as the MD of Kellogg where she worked in India & South Asia. She has also held senior management roles at Coca-Cola India and HSBC Bank. "She has the right experience in consumer-facing businesses like banking, food, FMCG," said Santrupt Misram who is the director, group Human Resources (HR), at Aditya Birla Group. A new start Pendurkar's appointment comes at a time when fashion clothing space is getting increasingly crowded with discount-heavy e-commerce players. The competition is getting even stiffer, due to the entry of international retailers such as Swedish firm H&M that entered the country in 2015. "In the last couple of years, Pantaloons brand is not too visible in the market," an industry insider said. "The fact that they have hired Pendurkar shows that they are reinventing their brand and strategy . It is her core strength. A very interesting hire, I must say," the person said. Pantaloons' previous CEO, Shital Mehta had quit in September last year. He joined Landmark Group as CEO of Max Fashions, another value retailer. Pantaloons Fashion Retail, a unit of Aditya Birla Fashion Retail Ltd, looks to refresh its branding and marketing strategy. This move has come in the face of unabated competition from cash-rich online marketplaces and offline value fashion retailers. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 18 Jan, 9.46 am

Delhi Daredevils (DD) fast bowler, Mohammed Shami, who was asked to stay back by Kolkata Police, post-Daredevils' match against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), has now been cleared to join his team in Bengaluru. The past one month is plagued with series allegations made by Shami's wife, Hasin Jahan, regarding domestic violence, physical and mental torture and even attempt to rape and murder. Delhi played their fourth game of the tournament at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata which they lost by a massive margin of over 70 runs.  Mohammed Shami leaked too many runs at his home ground against KKR. Credits: IPLT20.com The team already headed to Bengaluru for their fifth consecutive away game this season on April 21. The local police asked Shami to stay back as a part of the interrogation procedure. "We have got no objection in Shami joining his IPL side. But if need be, we will call him again," Praveen Tripathi, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), stated to the reporters as per NDTV. The interrogation session ran for over three hours. "We can call him anytime but at this point in time, we don't find it is necessary. He's fully cooperating in this case," affirmed Tripathi further.  Photo Credit: Web. However, Police did not provide any substantial judgement on whether the fast bowler is off the hook. "Satisfaction is not the answer. We examined him professionally, got our answers and after that the investigation will take its course," said the Joint Commissioner. Hasin Jahan also accused Shami's brother, Hasib Ahmed of an attempt to rape and murder in their hometown in UP.  Credit: PTI "I've no idea about the police escort. It's not in my knowledge. Please clarify this with the headquarters, safety and security of Indian players is a different issue, the two were interrogated separately as well as together," Tripathi concluded.

Lord Shiva which is a 'Hindi' term has originated from a beautiful concept of E + Shav = Shiva (Shav = Dead, and E = Energy). It means when energy flows into the dead body; it starts to live, hence called as Shiva. Which only denotes, we're all born Shivas. Shiva is one of the most important God in Hinduism and the crucial one in the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh (another name of Shiva) who represent Creation, Preservation, and Destruction respectively. Shiva is a destroyer, not only the destroyer of the establishment when the judgment day comes but also the destroyer of misery and hurdles in life.  It is not me who is saying this, but everything which you'll read in this story is an excerpt from a beautiful mythological book, "Dev Se Mahadev" by author Aakash Kailash Vijayvargiya. Coming from a renowned political background in Indore, India, Aakash read the entire 'Shivpuran' to understand Shiva as religion, which is known as 'Shiva Dharma'. He also researched well on the counterpart of mythology, science, to connect the both and bring in forth a concept which helps people understand different types of laws of 'Shiva Karma' to follow in their lives to attain the highest form of existence.  Have a look!  The first law of Shiva Karma is the truth. This law asks the followers to follow the path of truth, justice and being true to themselves and those who are around. Remember the dishonesty, and false deeds may prevail the small battles, but the truth always wins the war.  A single person cannot possess the knowledge of everything, but everyone may possess the knowledge of something. We should find that seed of knowledge within us, and then do all our karma around it.  No matter what life you're living, at what place you are; if your happiness depends on the materialistic things you own, then happiness is an illusion for you, and it'll be gone with that thing. The third law of Shiva Karma asks believers not to attach their happiness to earthly things.  The world we're living in is growing more self-obsessed. Everyone is worried about their happiness and doesn't care if people around them are happy or not. However, the real happiness is beyond limits, and it could be felt only when we have found the seed of knowledge within us, and we're truthful with others and ourselves. Remember, happiness comes from within, not outside.  If you may have noticed a happy person around you, you'll see that the illusion does not control them. You put them in any situation at any place; they'll be the same calm and content in their mind. So, the fifth and one of the most fundamental laws of Shiva Karma is practicing to be formless like water.  When our mind is at peace with heart, and we walk on the path of self-realization, all our senses come together to work in a proper synchronization. When you achieve this state in your physical form, the feeling you get is incomparable.  With these laws of Shiva Karma, you achieve the englightement. The highest form of existence for a human. In this state of mind, you attain self-realization along with the proper understanding of nature and reality. Enlightenment is the final state, and it can be achieved in this life only, without sacrificing the domestic life.  Aakash shares that "Shiva Dharma is not a religion, but the way of life. It's a process to attain everything that you ever need in your life."  To spread the awareness among people and promote the positive way of life in India, Aakash is working day and night on the concept of reciting '108 Om Chants'. Despite busy political schedules, Aakash takes out time to visit at least one 'Om Chant' event every single day without a miss, where people from all walks of life come together and meditate.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/punjab+woman+on+pilgrimage+converts+to+islam+marries+pak+resident-newsid-86074060| Top Stories Punjab woman on pilgrimage converts to Islam, marries Pak resident | A 31-year-old woman from Punjab's Hoshiarpur district, who went on a pilgrimage to Pakistan on April 12 ahead of Baisakhi festival as part of a delegation, has reportedly converted to Islam and married a Pakistan national based in Lahore. The woman Kiran Bala, a widow, has three children and was staying with her parents-in-law in Punjab. Her husband died in 2013. Kiran's father-in-law, Tarsem Singh, on Thursday added a new twist to the entire episode while expressing fear that his daughter-in-law may have fallen into the hands of Pakistan's ISI. He claimed that she was forced to convert to Islam.  The woman was a part of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) delegation that left for Pakistan on April 12. She went missing for four days in Pakistan. Now, she has applied for an extension of her visa in Pakistan, claiming a threat to her life in India, media reports said. Kiran's Pakistan visa will expire on April 21. According to reports, the woman converted to Islam from Darul-Aloom Jamia Naeemia in Lahore on April 16. Later, the marriage was solemnised with one Muhammed Azam, a resident of Lahore. She now has a new name - Amna Bibi. Hundreds of Indian Sikh pilgrims had gone to Pakistan on the occasion of Baisakhi on April 13 to visit historical Sikh shrines, including Panja Sahib Gurdwara near Lahore and Nankana Sahib Sikh shrine, which is the birthplace of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev. The pilgrimage to Pakistan has seen controversies over the week with officials of Pakistani agencies denying permission to Indian embassy officials based in Pakistan to meet the visiting delegation. The family said they have not been contacted officially by the SGPC or any authority to authenticate the information pouring out of media reports.

The latter allegedly took the extreme step after a gang barged into his house and assaulted and threatened him. The BJP local unit has called for a hartal in Varappuzha panchayat following the death of a youth at a hospital after he was taken into police custody and allegedly subjected to custodial torture.  "The cause of the episode was an altercation between Vasudevan and his neighbour the previous night. However, the incident was given a political colour after a 14-member gang attacked Vasudevan the next day," police said. The Varapuzha police booked Sreejith and the nine others arrested with various sections including that for abetting suicide, murder attempt and forceful entry into private property. However, the cops are yet to arrest first, second, third and sixth accused in the case.   The LDF had observed a hartal in Varappuzha on Saturday last following the incident. Meanwhile, police personnel have been deployed in strength at Varapuzha and also at the premises of the Kalamassery Medical College, where the autopsy of the youth's body will be held on Tuesday morning, to prevent untoward incidents.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/qrius-epaper-qrius/an+interview+with+kruti+bharucha+ceo+of+peepul+foundation-newsid-79464567| Featured An interview with Kruti Bharucha, CEO of Peepul Foundation |  By Amruth Chinnappa   Education sets an individual free. It is heartening to see private establishments like Peepul Foundation working together with Delhi's government schools to bring world-class education to their students. In an interview with Qrius, Ms Kruti Bharucha, the CEO of Peepul, talks about the foundation and its goals. She has worked in premier institutions like The World Bank, McKinsey & Co. and CEB Inc., following which she became the Country Director for Ark India, to heed her passion for ensuring quality education to children everywhere.   Can you let us know what prompted the shift from working as a Senior Director at CEB to being involved in the education sector?    I can remember being asked at the age of ten what I wanted to be when I grew up. Being a child of two economists, the expected answer was likely a professional degree. However, I wanted to reduce the inequality I saw in India and thought that building schools for the children that didn't receive a chance to go to school was one way to solve that problem.   2013 was a decision point for me. I was in the running to become a Managing Director at CEB but paused to really ask myself what I wanted to do in my career and professional life. The development sector kept pulling me back and I knew that my answer would be the same as what I would have said when I was ten years old.   For me, there was no time like the present and moving to the sector when I was in the prime of my career could really make a difference. Life has a way of bringing opportunities to you when you really want something and so, in 2014, I was appointed Country Director for Ark India.   What is Peepul's motto, and the driving force behind it?   Our motto is to transform children's lives through quality education. We want every child to realise their true potential irrespective of their background.   The issue is no more just getting children into school, it is making sure they have a high-quality education. 70% of the poorest children in India, most of whom rely on government schools, leave primary school without even basic reading or writing skills. Although government schools had good infrastructure, large classrooms and an adequate area for playing, parents were increasingly dissatisfied with the poor accountability structures and falling standards of education delivered in these schools. As a result, teachers feel disempowered, students feel apathetic, and parents feel frustrated.   Our work aims to be disruptive and address these low literacy levels by creating exemplary partnership schools within the government system, which will raise the expectations and revitalise the quality of public education in India.   What void in the present education system do you intend to fill with Peepul?   Our vision is to create a high-performing school network which will raise expectations and education standards. Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu showed the country what excellence means for their sport by performing at the highest levels and winning medals at the Olympics. They raised the bar and generated enthusiasm and interest for badminton in India. Parents now send their children to badminton academies with the hope of them becoming the next PV Sindhu. We want our schools to be centres of excellence that raise the bar for quality education in India.   What makes us different is that we are continuously learning and listening to feedback, course correcting and strengthening our programmes where we can to have a greater impact on learning outcomes.   How is the programme conducted? Tell us about CEDE: Child Education, Development and Empowerment, which is the focal point of your training.   Our education model is based on a rigorous approach to teaching and learning.   Our teachers are recruited from top colleges through an extremely rigorous selection process. They receive extensive training in practical, effective techniques for teaching young children the basics of language, reading, writing and mathematical concepts such as number, size and shape. Our focus is on mastery of Mathematics, English and Hindi. We have developed a strong curriculum, using the best international practices and guidance from reputed Indian experts.   We make sure we work with every child and develop individual learning plans for them. Colourful and interesting teaching-learning materials are used to ensure children are engaged. Rather than rote learning, which is the common practice, we give our pupils opportunities to learn through creative and social activities, which builds their confidence and imagination. We teach them how to behave, to respect each other and their teacher.   Our training for teachers focuses heavily on classroom management techniques and lesson planning. Regular classroom observations and feedback from the school leadership team provide teachers with a view to their strengths and how they can continuously develop.   Are students the sole beneficiaries? How do you select your students?   Our students are our primary but not the sole beneficiaries. Our school is non-selective, which means we do not restrict ourselves or select the students that we admit to the school. We admit all those in need of a good quality education.   The parents and families of these children are our second level beneficiaries. They are set to benefit in the future because their children can access a quality education at present, which will prepare them for life, allowing them to have a career of their choice and as a result help their families out of the circle of poverty. Our families come from communities located between 2 - 4.5 km from our schools. Our children's average family income is between Rs. 5,000 - 6,000 per month, though many survive on less than this. Most of our children are Hindi speaking, although we also have some with Tamil, Nepali, Bengali and Punjabi as their mother tongue.   Many public personalities like HRH Prince Charles and Najeeb Jung-Lieutenant Gov. of Delhi-have paid a visit to your institutions. How is the global and governmental outlook on the Indian education system with and without PPP: Public-Private Partnerships?   Yes, our schools have received recognition from several of our visitors. Just recently, Anil Swarup, Secretary, MHRD, who visited our school spoke to us about developing a prototype to be able to replicate our model.   PPPs need to be considered in India as a model for equalising educational opportunity to the economically and socially deprived segments of society. The current momentum around PPP in school education is a very positive development.   A larger discussion and introduction of various players into the PPP discourse is now required to explore how the government can create a sustainable ecosystem for players like Peepul to scale their work, what the necessary features of a stable and effective regulatory system are and the need for a dependable monitoring mechanism based on transparency and mutual trust is critical.   What hurdles unique to India did you face while implementing your programme? Let us know your thoughts on the widespread preference of literacy over education in schools, where marks are seen as a benchmark of success, rather than knowledge.   When we began our schools, the learning levels of the children were very low. The children we serve have not had access to toys, learning materials or books, all crucial for cognitive development. Most being first-generation learners, had never been read to and their vocabulary levels were much lower in comparison to children from affluent backgrounds. Few had any understanding of expected classroom behaviour.   Now, we have developed strong school routines. Students know how to listen to instructions, pay attention, participate, work with their peers, and are truly getting the most out of the school day. The emphasis on good hygiene, regular health check-ups and the provision of an additional meal at our flagship school have significantly improved the health of many children.   Being used to rote learning as the only method of teaching and notebooks being filled as a matter of course, many parents worried that their child was spending their time at school simply playing. However, they now understand that the activities being done in school are leading to their children learning faster than they could by rote methods.   What changes have you observed as a result of Peepuls intervention in this field and what do you wish to see in India's schools by 2027?   Our students have made great progress, both academically and in terms of their behaviour. Our year-end assessments showed significant student growth, 76% of all students either met or exceeded grade-level expectations across all 3 subjects-English, Hindi and Mathematics. Strong classroom routines and behaviour trackers help us maintain a high standard of discipline among our students.   Based on our proof of concept, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) extended the programme under the name of School Quality Enhancement Programme (SQEP) in 2016. There are now 30 SDMC schools partnered with NGOs. All the partner organizations, including Peepul schools, are working in partnership to increase enrolment and the quality of education in these schools. Key performance indicators and school-specific targets for enrolment, teacher and student attendance, student retention and student academic achievement are being tracked to ensure that there is a focus on quality.   What challenges are you currently facing and how do you think they could be alleviated?   The first key challenge faced by us is f inancial sustainability. Due to lack of a sustainability model with the government, we end up investing our own resources to keep the quality of our programme high. As a result, there is a perpetual requirement of gap funding which impacts the sustainability of school operations and causes us to shift our energy to raising funds and away from managing daily operations. In the long run, until a cost-per-child reimbursement model is in place (or similar financial reimbursement), operators such as Peepul may not have an incentive to enter whole school management contracts.   The other challenge lies in ensuring there is data to assess the improvement in learning outcomes at the partnership schools. Since this is a quality intervention, it is critical to measure the student outcomes at government schools and across grades to conduct an appropriate baseline and end line. Assessments are not conducted uniformly across all government schools making it difficult to compare the actual improvement in the partnership school with any other standard of performance.   How can interested people help your organisation?   Quality education is critical to the economic success of individuals and the whole country, and it is imperative that responsible individuals and businesses support right initiatives, especially for disadvantaged children. We need to give the growing young population the skills they need to succeed in the global economy.   Few ways in which interested people can support our work are:   Featured Image Credits: srsvasisht on Visual Hunt / CC BY-NC-SA  Dailyhunt	|Monday, 08 Jan, 8.16 am

"Since all other sports bodies which are listed as NSFs are covered under the RTI Act, it is inconceivable as to why BCCI should be an exception," the Commission observed in its report."It is recommended that, the same be explicitly mentioned in the list of NSFs available on the website of Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. This express mention would automatically bring BCCI within the purview of RTI Act," it said. The Law Commission underlined that "even if BCCI is continued to be regarded as a private body", but owing to its "monopolistic character coupled with the public nature of its functions and the substantial financing it has received from governments over the years (in the form of tax exemptions, land grants et al), it can within the existing legal framework, still be termed as a ï¿½public authority' and be brought within the purview of RTI Act".It also pointed out that the uniform of the players of the Indian cricket team (as selected by the BCCI) contains the national colours and their helmets display the Ashok Chakra. Besides, it said, the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that BCCI is the "approved" national level body holding virtually monopoly rights to organise cricketing events in the country.The report has recommended that the BCCI "be viewed as an agency or instrumentality of state, under Article 12 of the Constitution, thereby making it amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 12". "Additionally, it is recommended that RTI Act be made applicable to BCCI along with all of its constituent member cricketing associations, provided they fulfil the criteria applicable to BCCI, as discussed in this report," it added.

While April 27 is just a few weeks away, Marvel is elevating the excitement level of all the fans are increasing day by day. The release of the most anticipated movie of the year, the most ambitious crossover in the history of cinema... yeah, yeah, we have all seen the memes. Take it easy! With movie spoiler leaks on the rise, director brothers Joe and Anthony Russo have asked fans to refrain themselves from giving away any spoilers of the  Avengers: Infinity War , as doing so will not only ruin the experience for the audience, but will also be a huge setback for the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.  So to prevent the spoilers from spilling out and about, Marvel has only screened 30 minutes of the movie, that too for select cast and audiences, and the whole movie has not been shown to ANY of the cast members of this magnum opus. At the 30 min premiere in London, UK, Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays Doctor Strange) told Good Morning America that, "It was pretty hyped. It was wonderful. It was the same for us. We haven't seen hadn't seen the footage until last night, so we came out as fanned up as the fans. It was really, really exciting."  Tom Hiddleston, who plays Thor's brother Loki, went on to say that just a small portion of Avengers: Infinity War. He said, "None of us have seen the film and we'll be seeing it at the same time as you guys see it on April the 27th because there's so much about the film that's being kept under wraps, being kept secret. Last night was about 20 minutes and the first time I've seen it."  In another interview, Tom has further revealed, "...the reason they're not screening the whole film is because there are so many new things that happen in it - things that have never happened before in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - that it's just more exciting if everyone in the world sees the film at the same time... So that feels new for me, having been in the Marvel Universe for awhile."  While Black Panther is still running in the theatres, T'Challa is sitting on the throne of the third-highest grossing film in North American history, grossing over $665.4 million dollars in the domestic market, making both Disney and Marvel Studios proud of taking the high profiled leap.

A rule change may make you pay more taxes | A large chunk of the reimbursement part of employees working in private sector may come under taxation net as the government is said to be mulling over bring "indirect earning" under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The relevant amendment in the GST rules may be discussed and approved in the next meeting of the GST Council. The idea of bringing reimbursements under the GST net flows from a recent ruling of the Authority of Advance Rulings (AAR) on canteen charges. The AAR ruled that the canteen charges recovered from an employee were to GST rates. This ruling may prompt employers to stop charging for canteen services in a bid to save taxes, which, in turn, is likely to impact the salary packages. The employers would not prefer to increase the cost to company for their employees.  In a case involving a Kerala-based footwear company Caltech Polymers, the AAR ruled, "recovery of food expenses from the employees for the canteen services provided by company would come under the definition of 'outward supply' as defined in Section 2(83) of the Act, 2017, and therefore, taxable as a supply of services under GST." Is the ruling going to impact other parts of reimbursement component of salary? "The decisions by the Authority of Advance Rulings are not binding on the GST Council. Both are independent of each other. The AAR works under finance ministry and has a lot to do with the Income Tax department while the GST is dealt with by a separate GST Council," chartered accountant Manindra Tiwari told Indiatoday.com. "However, the GST Council may consider the rulings given by the AAR while considering revision in GST rules. The logic is simple: the reimbursements are not taxed because they are claimed after expenses have been made and relevant taxes already paid. But, the counter logic is that reimbursements involve earnings made indirectly and hence should be taxed," Tiwari further explained. There has been an argument that the companies may be making recoveries avoiding taxes through salaries of their employees without issuing due invoices. "There is strong likelihood that some part of reimbursement may be brought under indirect taxation through GST," Tiwari said. If the GST Council agrees to expand the ambit of the GST to bring reimbursements under the indirect tax net, it is certainly going to burn bigger holes in the pockets of employees working in private sectors. So, reimbursements on home rentals, telephone bills, premiums for additional health insurance coverage, health check-ups, conveyance, gym, professional attires, entertainment or similar expenditure may attract GST. The corporates may soon be found restructuring salaries of their employees, to pass on the additional GST cost on to employees. ALSO READ Dailyhunt	|Monday, 16 Apr, 1.30 pm

Directed by Tanvir Ahsan and produced by TV Wala Media for SVF Entertainment., SIX is a nerve-wracking story of a copywriter named Soumyo Roy and how his life turns upside down following the death of his wife under mysterious circumstances. The Bengali entertainment world has not seen anything like this before, making it the first-ever psychological thriller web series in Bengali.  SIX will also introduce actor Nishan Nanaiah, who plays Soumya in SIX, to the Bengali audience. This is the first time the actor of 12 critically acclaimed Malayalam, three Telugu and two Bollywood movies will perform in any Bengali project.

He has also won awards like the Asianet Film Award for Best New Face (2009) and the World Malayalee Council and Kairali TV award for Best Debut (2009). Soumyo Roy, who works in an advertising agency, is deeply in love with his wife Rikhiya. On weekends, he prefers to hang out with his wife or his select group of friends or simply cook. One day, he skips his office meeting to have a lunch date with his wife. But when he arrives at the restaurant where they arranged to meet, he fails to find Rikhiya there. Instead, he bumps into a gorgeous woman at the restaurant who introduces herself as Razia, a colleague of his wife. The stunning woman, who has become the centre of attraction at the eatery, tells him, much to his surprise, that Rikhiya got held up in the office and won't be able to meet him. She also hands him a note purportedly From his wife. As Razia leaves, Soumya glances at the note From his wife, which, to his utter shock, says "can't stay with you anymore." As Soumya wonders why Rikhiya would write a note like this and thinks of calling her, his phone rings. A neighbour, Mrs. Dutta, is on the other end, urging him to return home right away since his wife was found dead. From that moment, Soumya Roy's life changes forever. He emerges as the prime suspect, with the police accusing him of murdering his wife. No one believes what he has to say, not even his friends or colleagues. A desperate Soumya manages to escape, becoming a fugitive. The man on the run now has only one mission-to capture the killer of his wife and prove his innocence.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/india+should+adopt+the+peasant+food+web+as+a+sustainable+practice-newsid-86046031| Analysis India should adopt the peasant food web as a sustainable practice | Even as India witnesses persistent agricultural distress and farmer protests, there is a food revolution underway across the world. It is a true David (or more accurately, Davids) versus Goliath story, of what is called the peasant food web, taking on the industrial food chain. This revolution isn't happening in any one place, but all across the world. Like most revolutions, it is a fight that is being fuelled by grassroots energy and activism. And this is why it is bound to succeed. In the coming years, India - completely by accident - could be one of the key theatres for this victory.  The terms industrial food chain and peasant food web were coined to contrast two competing food systems, in a report titled 'Who will feed us?' published in 2017 by the ETC Group, a research institution working on ecology, technology and economics. The report says the peasant food web is not a pseudonym for agro-ecology, organic farming, permaculture, or any other production system. Were organic farming employed throughout food production, we would be closer to food security but not necessarily closer to food sovereignty. The industrial food chain (IFC) refers to the various components of the links running from production inputs to consumption outcomes, and includes crop and livestock genomics, pesticides and fertilisers, as well as transportation and processing systems. The chain controls the policy environment of the world's most important resource - our food. The peasant food web (PFW) is made of small-scale producers, usually family or women-led, that include farmers, livestock-keepers and urban/peri-urban producers. While some peasants do use chemicals for commercial produce, most of what PWF produces is de facto organic. The statistics about the relative share of these two food systems in feeding the world are quite stunning: The PFW caters to more than 70% of the world's food needs, compared to 30% by the IFC, and yet only consumes 25% of the energy for this, compared to 75% of energy consumed by the IFC. And yet, advocates of the IFC have so far won most of the policy battles, defining government regulations in virtually every country. Our solutions for food systems are tilted towards IFC-based solutions: larger and more commercial farms, more mechanisation, more chemical fertiliser and pesticides, etc. This isn't because those who are advocating for industrial-scale solutions are evil, or morally compromised - rather, many are intensely public-spirited and have been seized by the gigantic challenge of feeding our populations.  But change is coming from two independent streams: first, from the growing awareness of the long-term negative consequences of adopting IFC - such as monoculture (growing only one crop), or the impact of chemical fertilisers and pesticides on the inherent quality of the soil and final produce. Second, from a new force not evident a decade earlier - the steadily increasing sustainable food movement at the grassroots, aimed at providing a viable alternative to feed the world.  The emerging change is being propelled not by unsubstantiated sentimentality, but by scientific evidence. The scientific community which earlier was an ally of the industrial chain system, is now more frequent in its support of the food web as a sustainable practice, with favourable research findings on how the food web approach results in better soil quality, less water usage, and superior food quality.  What are the components of a successful 'food web' approach, and what is needed for the adoption of such an approach? Four key elements may be considered as critical components of this model: no use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides; diversity in seed banks; small landholdings by farmers and growers; and proximity to end consumer markets.  A shift from using unhealthy chemicals as well as genetically modified seeds, requires determined champions to continue their policy advocacy to find the right solutions and political leadership. Establishing enabling food policies is critical to ensure that important experiments don't become innovation fireflies. The second two components are interlinked to regional land zoning plans, and demand side urban economics. For the model to work, there is a minimum catchment of demand, and a local geographic footprint to the supply. Urban centres are the logical theatres for such models to work. The success of the model depends upon a critical mass of urban consumers who are demanding better quality food, and who will not only sustain the economics of this approach, but also act as a tipping point for more consumer conversion. Combined with adequate demand, minimising the farm to table distance is critical to ensure the economics of the approach. With adequate incentives, farmers will switch their growing practices, and be able to quickly see the economic gain from doing so. Such a localised food system allows all four components to work together. When there is adequate policy support, this local, 'small is beautiful' food web approach may be able to build a quiet foundation, which grows organically over time to take an increasing share of the food wallet of the urban consumer.

An educated person is held in high regard for serving the greater good. Nelson Mandela once said , " Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world". With great minds like him vouching for education as sagaciously, it becomes the inner-breath of a civilization. Of course, in a rapidly developing country like India, education is considered as the backbone of economy. There is no denying that our education system is corrupt and dysfunctional and it is high time we have given it a new spin.  Our porous education system requires a sweeping change where parents across India spend quite a fortune to provide their children the rightful education. Sadly enough, an honest educational institute sounds more like an oxymoron in India and there are myriad mediocre educational institutes that are growing like ferns that are only plaguing the system, forget serving. So, here are the names of some Countries that have best education system and it is treated with utmost important and institutes are tied with stringent rules:  Countries that have best education system   1 - South Korea:  South Korea's spurt in the literacy level set an example for the world in the past few decades. There is equal-opportunity approach system where students can get access to elementary education.     2 - Japan:  Schools in Japan don't corner students who possess lesser merit citing adversity in the psyche. They don't hold exams until they reach fourth grade and there is no compulsory high-schooling in Japan.     3 - Finland:  Finland stands out for its innovating schooling system which promotes vocational training from the primary school itself. The schools teach practical financial skills to every student and all the schools are aided by the government.     4 - Singapore:  There is a striking similarity between Singaporean and Indian education system. Teachers weigh the ability of the student and treat them accordingly but Singapore's education system is centralized, integrated and well-funded.     5 - Canada:  There is a remarkable maintaining of consistency in the Canadian educational system. The education is funded by federal departments and varies from province to province.     6 - Switzerland:  Education is compulsory for everyone even if someone is not holding the legal residency status. The education is funded by the state and a student only has to meet the expenses of the school supplies, books and school trips.     7 - Hong Kong:  The government have freed students from giving education fees until 12 years of their educational life. The public exams are also removed that hindered some students to enter high schools.    These are the Countries that have best education system - India should immediately take cue from these countries and hone the education system. If the nation wants to prosper, it needs more fertile minds and that's that. Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 23 Dec, 4.36 pm

He also sought the release of the Bhaskar Rao Commission report. The committee investigated why the police had fired on a crowd that had gathered near the mosque to protest moments after the explosion. The Hindu quoted the Hyderabad MP as saying: "Tomorrow, which is Friday, at 4 pm, we will meet the governor of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and we will place before him these facts and demand that Centre order a retrial or appeal against the case in the Supreme Court. Re-investigation can be taken up under the Criminal Procedure Code. We have also told Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao and deputy chief minister that they should take up the matter with the Centre." Owaisi accused the NIA of toeing the line of its "political masters" and said the objective was to get the accused acquitted, reported The Hindu."When the trial started in the case, the National Investigation Agency changed the advocate and an advocate who did not fight a single murder case was handed over this case," he said, adding that in such a terror case, an advocate with at least 10 years' experience should have been appointed.Referring to the 2013 Dilsukhnagar blast, in which five people were sentenced to death, Owaisi said an IPS officer was present at every hearing. During the Mecca Masjid trial, however, only officers of the rank of inspector were present, he pointed out.Owaisi criticised the BJP government's silence on the verdict. "Not a single central minister has reacted to the verdict or [the way forward] on the Mecca Masjid blast case verdict," he added.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/uber+doubling+down+on+india+investments-newsid-86011326| Business Uber doubling down on India investments | Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is "doubling down" on its investments in India, one of its biggest markets, after its recent exit from Southeast Asia, its chief operating officer said on Wednesday. India accounts for more than 10% of Uber rides globally and the US company has a more than 35% share of the taxi market there, according to Counterpoint Research, but it is yet to make money in the country. COO Barney Harford said investments in India are made using funds from profitable markets. However, the sale in March of Uber's business in Southeast Asia to Singapore's Grab Holdings, in exchange for a 27.5% stake, has given Uber more firepower to . compete with its Indian rival Ola.  "The recent merger ... has freed up resources which we are going to invest across people, products and partnerships to better serve this country," Harford told reporters in New Delhi. India is a core market "We are doubling down on our investments in this country like never before," he said, adding that India was a core market for the San Francisco-based company. Harford did not say how much Uber is likely to invest in India but said it would "considerably expand" its technology resources to develop products for India and the world. Uber's India head Amit Jain said the company has no major plans to expand to more cities in India. Uber operates in about 30 Indian cities while Ola is in 110 cities and has more than a 45 percent total market share, according to Counterpoint Research. Uber and Ola are backed by a common investor, SoftBank Group, which pushed behind the scenes for the merger between Uber and Grab. It is not clear whether the Japanese investor plans to spur consolidation in India as well. Executives from Uber and Ola met at least twice over the past 12 months and, among other things, Uber brought up a potential merger between the two companies with Uber in the driver's seat, sources have told Reuters. Harford said that while Uber was always open to having conversations with potential partners, it had no interest in entering into minority deals in India or other countries in which it operates.

The conversation is in stark contrast to her denial of the act and her claim that her words were misinterpreted. The conversation is said to have taken place between March 2 and March 18 between Nirmala Devi and her students. The students had submitted the copies of the chat along with their complaint to the college management. Here are a few screenshots that were released by  News18:            During the conversation, she goes on to say, "You all very well know about the competition that exists in the world and it takes not only talent but also intelligent approach mentally and physically to achieve success coupled with money and fame (sic)."  "All the six of you are talented...If they are okay (with the offer), please ask them to send me good morning and good evening messages in capitals letters. Only after that I will speak to the reliable one. If you are not willing, definitely you are all missing the good opportunity. (sic)"  She then proceeds to say, "I too have two girl children like you, so I will think a lot in all the matters... I am going to execute my plan next week... I will GUIDE you academically and financially.. also in the career. The more you keep up the secrecy, the more will you be appreciated by all. (sic)". In reply, one of the girls says, "Mam, I did not expect this from you. This won't suit me and my family. So please do not talk about this henceforth." Continuing to lure the girl, she wrote, "When luck knocks your door, you ought to use it. Luck comes once in a while," for which they girl responded saying, "This is not luck, for me, it is a SIN." Meanwhile, another girl strictly warns the tainted professor not to speak like that to any other girl and that she remains quiet, giving respect to her age and position. The assistant professor in her further conversation says, "I suggested this as I see a small but strong ladder. I decided to speak about this after seeing them show care in matters concerning safety. I also gave a similar reply like you once upon a time but the situation changes. I understood that work will not stop due to us refusing it." Lastly, Nirmala Devi wrote, "I have missed so many opportunities and I will consider this too similarly... If you are not interested, leave it. I will convey it to them. They will look for other people." Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 7.10 pm3 days ago4 days ago4 days ago4 days ago3 days ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+siasat+daily+english-epaper-siaseten/the+imam+who+saved+not+just+asansol+but+perhaps+india+from+burning-newsid-85171289| India The imam who saved not just Asansol, but perhaps India from burning | NEW DELHI/ASANSOL: Imam Imadadul Rashidi's voice was matter of fact when contacted by The Citizen, as if what he had done was what any one would do. Asansol was in the grip of violence threatened by a tornado as the Muslims started gathering to retaliate against the violence triggered by Ram Navami processions. Why? Because the Imam's 16 year old son had been brutally beaten to death by a communal mob, and the news of the incident had spread like wildfire across the town. The crowds gathered, with now the police and the state government aware of their own helplessness, when the Imam addressed a congregation of thousands at the funeral prayers of his son Sibtullah Rashidi who had just appeared for teh Class X Board examinations. With his son's body lying before him, the Imam pleaded for peace in a short address that had the entire crowd in tears, with all then dispersing for their respective homes.  As he told The Citizen this morning, all he said was, "my child has lived the life that Allah ordained for him. Now please ensure that no one else's child is killed, that there is peace and amity. If you love him, and me, do not turn to violence, but keep peace." Asked how difficult a statement this was Imam Rashidi said quietly, " no it was not, it was clear to me that my child had died, there was nothing we could do about that, and it was thus my duty to ensure no other child died, no house was torched, no family bereaved." He said he was responding to the anger in "my" Asansol, where people were bent on taking revenge. "I knew I had to stop this, I knew this was necessary for harmony in my shahr (town) and in my country" he said. "I knew my child has lived the life Allah had marked for him, I pleaded with the people not to kill anyone else's child, " he said. The Imam made it clear to the congregation that "if you do not listen to me I will leave Asansol and go away." He said he was firm about that, as he could not bear the thought of more violence and bloodshed. The Imam said that he told the people exactly what he believed. "Islam is a religion of peace and amity, it does not preach violence and revenge," he said. Asked what he would like to convey to the country where communal harmony is currently under stress, he said, " I would only say please do all you can to ensure there is peace and unity. And no one is able to break that." Local Asansol Councillor Nasim Ansari said that he had attended the prayers like everyone else. There was not a dry eye after the Imam spoke for "maybe just seven or eight minutes". He said they could see the anger being replaced by deep sorrow as the congregation dispersed and all made their way peacefully home. Ansari told The Citizen that the Imam spoke in measured tones but from the heart. His words "tore through the anger" and diffused it. He said that there was deep worry across the administration and the state as the Muslims reacted to the brutal death of young Rashidi, and a realisation that the storm if it burst would not be controlled easily. The Chief Minister had replaced police officers in the district, bringing back those who enjoyed a better rapport with the people at large. Even so the murder of the Imam's teenage son seemed to be a turning point, with the Muslims after four long years, prepared to face the consequences of retaliatory violence. As Ansari said, "I cannot even begin to say what might have happened across India had it not been for the Imam." Subsequently, he said, "we have been able to go back to restoring peace, returning cattle, and speaking to both communities." Ansari himself was under fire even as he was speaking to this reporter, for his mediation efforts but as he said "these are just a handful of lumpens, we have them in all communities but the situation now is dramatically improved." He fought the local polls as an Independent but has subsequently joined the Trinamool Congress. The Imam's son, as per verified reports, was taken away by the mob in Rail Par area of Asansol. His elder son alerted the family who tried to get police help. The delay on the part of the police to act, as has become customary in all such incidents now across India, led to the brutal bludgeoning of the young boy who was killed on the spot by the instigated mob. Fake news, videos, rumours were being spread through out Asansol to "provoke" the majority community to react with violence, as per the local administration. Asansol has a MP from the Bharatiya Janata Party Babul Supriyo who is currently warring with the state government for not allowing him free access to his constituency. The last communal violence in Asansol was in 1991-92, after which it has been peaceful until the last few years when efforts to stoke communal fires succeeded in thsi Ram Nevamil celebrations with weapons, and provocative slogans. The violence has continued unabated, and the area remains tense. http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/en/newsdetail/index/2/13412/the-imam-who-saved-not-just-asansol-but-perhaps-india-from-burning Dailyhunt	|Friday, 06 Apr, 7.53 pm3 weeks ago3 weeks ago3 weeks ago3 weeks ago3 weeks ago

Snooker is rarely chosen by athletes as it is considered one of the toughest sport. Setting apart this tradition, she has chosen this game and proved herself worthy for same. 14 year old Ishika Shah from Indore(M.P), has added another feather to the hat by winning bronze at IBSF World Under-18 Girls Snooker Championship at Mol, Belgium making the end of the year 2016 more rewarding and fantastic.  Excerpts from the conversation with the snooker prodigy:  1.Tell us about your inspiring sports journey. How did you cope up with the hurdles in between?  It has been tough, sometimes rewarding and sometimes teaching me lessons. My Snooker journey so far is full of leanings, challenges and inspiration drawn from many ideals. Right from picking the cue for the first time till whatever little i have achieved gives me immense satisfaction. Taking participation in various tournaments across the globe need you to do lot of adjustments. Maintaining the same spirit is sometimes very challenging, but at the same time it teaches you so much.     2. Why did you choose Snooker as your sport from a pool of very popular sports like Tennis, badminton etc.  When i look back, I found it the most difficult and best decision I have ever made. I was not pressurized for choosing this but presented with option. My father inspired me to choose snooker. It came from inside when I keep seeing my father playing this sport. Gradually, my interest started generating in this and that's how I got in it. I never compared my sport with any other sport on any basis. For me its something which I can play from my whole zeal and energy.  3. How do you think your game has evolved over the years as far as your own expectations are considered?  My game is definitely getting evolved day by day after getting tough competition from various Indian as well as other country players. Every game of mine teaches me and motivates me to do better, it gives me different dimension always and thus its in improvement stage. But yes! I need to learn a lot more when it comes to my expectations, and I'm confident that I will try to do the best in snooker in times to come.  4. If I had to ask you, what are the two or three strengths that you would pick as your game cornerstones?  When it comes to my strength, my first strength is my father who always guides me on how to improve my skills. When it comes to table during the game I always concentrate on my moves and game instead of bothering about against whom I'm playing with. I just keep my head coll and plan my moves as per the position of table and what best can be done in that situation.     5. Back in 2016 ,you nailed it by winning Sub-junior National Snooker Championship title. How did managed the pressure during game when you defeated Anushi Seth by 50-2,50-33 in the final match?  As I mentioned earlier that I always try to keep cool during the game.It is one of the important aspects which has helped me always. I was just concentrating on my best. Of course when you inches closer to the title it creates a pressure to perform better but I try to just remember to perform better. The title can be yours if u make your moves properly and tension free.  6. How do you strike a balance between academics and sports ?Are you aspiring for a career in Snooker?  When it comes to my studies I must thank my school and teachers. They always help me to maintain the balance and are ready to help me when I am out for tournaments. They cover up the course and clear my doubts. Of course it affects your other hobbies and socializing but I am happy the way I'm moving ahead.  7. You have struggled and worked desperately hard to achieve this feat. What would be your advice to aspiring snooker players?  Be clear in what you want. Do not let any pressure mount on you. Always play your best game even when you are with a weaker competitor and never take your game lightly. Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 01 Mar, 5.06 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/mykhel-epaper-mykhel/why+roman+reigns+didn+t+win+wwe+wrestlemania+34+main+event-newsid-85764063| Latest Why Roman Reigns didn't win WWE Wrestlemania 34 main event? | Bengaluru, April 15: Wrestlemania 34 gave us an extremely physical matchup between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar. In recent times, we hadn't seen such a brutal matchup where the ring was covered with blood. But, then again, that's what the 'main event' between these two competitors are all about. The finish saw an F-5 from Brock Lesnar to get the job done to retain his title. The end came as pretty much shocking one since Roman Reigns was the favorite to win the title on that night. This match was built up for the last one year to portray him as the top babyface of the company with the prime title in hand. So, the audience, as well as the sources, were struck with disbelief after witnessing the finish.  It was an entertaining match without a doubt as Brock Lesnar had to hit six F5s and a dozen of suplexes to finally pin his challenger. Maybe, this much punishment was reserved to get more sympathy from the crowd. But, the result turned out to be complete opposite as the New Orleans crowd denied to give any cheers to The Big Dog. This is the prime reason due to which the original plans got changed at Wrestlemania 34, at the very last moment. According to Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter, The Boss took the call at the very last moment seeing that the audience was not getting 'over' with Roman Reigns. Check out the quotes from the source, 'Essentially, as far as I know, it's still going to Roman Reigns and I think that he knew and they all knew this is probably one of the reasons that it happened the way it did was that this crowd there was just nothing that they could do. They could do every trick in the book, this crowd had decided that they were going to hate the match." This reaction was not going to help the Samoan Superstar's coronation at Wrestlemania. So, McMahon might he decided to hold the plans for the next big event in line, Greatest Royal Rumble. This, in turn, also helped to fool the entire audience who expected to see a tailor-made title win for The Guy. Check out the further updates from the source on this, 'They absolutely knew this crowd was going to boo Roman Reigns winning the championship really bad and after all the work they did they understood that this was going to be the case. There are many different reasons why it happened. Some of it was just the idea of fooling people. Some of it again was they knew Roman Reigns thing wasn't getting over at all." Some of the rumors even suggest that Roman Reigns himself was not aware of the change of planning until he entered the arena and received negative reactions, all over. So, he too was pretty much frustrated about it. Hopefully, he can capture the title, pretty quick as Lesnar is said to have re-signed a short-term contract with the company.

The Assembly election, now barely four months away, is set to witness a pitched battle between the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP with the JD(S) too gearing up to prove a point that it can't be wished away. It's not going to be a cakewalk for the Congress this time after it won seven of the nine Assembly seats in Kalaburagi in 2013, demolishing the saffron party which had to contend with a split down the middle with veteran B.S. Yeddyurappa walking out to form his KJP. The political scene has drastically changed and though it's still a bit too early to make predictions, a tough race is no doubt on the cards. Yeddyurappa is straining every sinew to prove he has lost none of his clout over the Lingayats and at the other end, Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge is keen to assert himself as the undisputable top leader of Hyderabad-Karnataka with the venerable Dharam Singh not around.     Members of Legislative Assembly      Although the undivided Kalaburagi district (which included the present day Yadgir district ) was a strong bastion of the Congress since Independence, it was the emergence of the Janata Parivar in the early eighties that broke the stranglehold of the Congress in the region. Of late, the BJP too has gained a foothold in the district, especially after Lingayat leader and former CM B.S. Yeddyurappa assumed the mantle of the party at the state level. The political leadership of Kalaburagi has not only dominated the politics of Hyderabad-Karnataka but has also played a key role in state politics. After the downfall of former CM Veerendra Patil in the early nineties, Mallikarjun Kharge and Dharam Singh totally dominated Congress affairs not only in the district but also in the region. In the 2013 Assembly election, the Congress made big gains in the district winning seven of the nine seats due to two factors-the conferring of special status on the backward H-K region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution and the division of BJP votes due to launch of the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) by Mr Yeddyurappa. As a result, the BJP which had won five seats in the district in 2004, was able to retain only one in 2013- Gulbarga South- where the Revoor family can sway voters like no one else. On the other hand, the Congress tally improved from four in 2004 to seven in 2013. But a lot of water has flowed under the Bhima bridge since the 2013 election. The issue of conferring special status on the HK region has faded from public memory and it's no more a dominant factor in this election. And secondly, former BJP leaders who had quit the party to join KJP, have reverted to their parent organization. The third factor which may work against the Congress is the demise of two prominent leaders- N Dharam Singh and Qamrul Islam, who had a large following in the district. Although Mr Kharge has emerged much stronger now at the national level with his appointment as Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, his influence has been affected after senior leaders such as Malikayya Guttedar, late Qamrul Islam besides former ministers from neighbouring Yadgir district, Dr Malakraddy and Baburao Chinchansur raised the banner of revolt against him following the elevation of his son Priyank Kharge as Minister. Although these leaders are lying low at the moment, they are expected to strike at the right moment during the coming elections and could affect the prospects of the party. The absence of Mr Singh, who was known for his suave style and his ability to strike a chord with people, may affect the chances of the Congress not only in Jewargi which he represented eight times without a break, but also in many constituencies not only in the district but in neighbouring Bidar district as well. Similarly the sudden demise of Mr Islam, who was the unchallenged leader of the dominant Muslim community in the district, has created a big void in the community. Till Mr Islam was alive, winning the Gulbarga North seat (earlier Gulbarga Assembly) was an easy task for the party. But now, retaining the seat and also the Muslim vote bank has now become a big challenge as Mr Islam never allowed a second rung leader to grow in the party. While the followers of Mr Islam are demanding the ticket for Mr Islam's wife, it's ultimately Mr Kharge who will have the last word on the issue. If Mr Kharge, who was at loggerheads with late Islam, decides to back his follower Ilyas Bhagwan, whom he got appointed as chairman of the North-West Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and refuses the ticket to Mr Islam's wife, the party may see a major upheaval. Another worry for the Congress in the constituency is Mr Nasir Hussain who may contest as the JD(S) candidate. Till Mr Islam was alive, Mr Hussain, who contested in the previous election as KJP candidate, could not succeed much in winning over the Muslim electorate. But the absence of Mr Islam has created a big opportunity for this young leader. Some political observers are ready to bet on Mr Hussain saying if there is a chance of JD(S) winning a lone seat, it's this one. The BJP contenders for the Gulbarga North seat are senior leader Mr Shashil Namoshi, entrepreneur Rajgopal Reddy and industrialist B.G. Patil's son Chandu Patil. In the Kalaburagi South seat where sitting BJP MLA Dattatreya Patil Revoor will be the candidate again, he may face a challenge from the Congress, which is yet to finalise its candidate and from an independent, Basavaraj Diggavi as well. If the latter, who is likely to eat into the BJP vote bank, manages to garner substantial votes, then he may help the chances of the Congress candidate. Congressmen in the race for this seat are former MLC Allamprabhu Patil, Kalaburagi Mayor Sharanu Modi and the Block Congress President Neelakant Mulage. In so far as the Kalaburagi Rural constituency is concerned, the scene is pretty hazy. Due to old age and poor health, the Congress has decided not to give the ticket to sitting MLA G Ramakrishna this time. He may be replaced by son Vijaykumar. In the BJP, former minister Revu Naik, who got elected four times from the constituency without a break before losing in the 2013 election due to the entry of the KJP candidate, would have bagged the ticket on a platter as he enjoys a good rapport not only with his Banjara community, who are in substantial numbers in the constituency, but also with other communities. But his decision to continue in the BJP when the KJP was launched by Mr Yeddyurappa, has strained his relationship with the latter. In case the party leadership rejects his plea for the Assembly ticket on the ground he would be the candidate for the Kalaburagi Lok Sabha seat in 2019, a Zilla Panchayat member, Basavaraj Mattimud or the BJP State Vice-President Baburao Chavan, who contested on the KJP ticket in 2013, may be the candidate. In the high profile Chittapur constituency, minister Priyank Kharge has made the going tough for himself due to his 'inaccessibility' and 'autocratic' style of functioning. Although Mr Priyank has been able to bring a lot of funds to his constituency, he has earned a lot of enemies owing to his abrasive style. Recently a big chunk of leaders led by former MLA Vishwanth Patil Hebbal left the Congress protesting against his "style of functioning" and their neglect in the party. This feeling is widespread and may make the going tough for him at the hustings. Considering the high percentage of Lambani voters in the constituency, the BJP has decided to field its former MLA, Valmiki Naik, who won in the 2009 by-election, but lost to Priyank in 2013, from Chittapur again. In Afzalpur, six term Congress MLA Malikayya Guttedar is pitted against his traditional rival M.Y. Patil, who will be in the fray this time as BJP candidate. An old war horse Mr Patil entered politics in the seventies and has been fighting elections without a break on different party symbols since 1978. But he has been able to get elected only twice- in 1978 and 2004. In 2013, he fought on a KJP ticket. It remains to be seen whether Mr Patil's appeal to voters to give him a last chance will see him through (He has decided not to contest in future). Going by the outstanding performance of the BJP under Mr Patil's stewardship in the recent Zilla Panchayat and taluk panchayat elections in Afzalpur taluk, one may get the impression that he may have an easy win in the coming Assembly election. But political observers believe that as in the previous elections Mr Guttedar, who wields 'enormous money, muscle and liquor power,' will marshal his resources well on time to inflict a defeat on his rivals, including those in the Congress party who want to see his downfall.  In Aland too, the fight will be between two traditional rivals- B.R. Patil and Subash Guttedar. In the changed scenario, Mr Patil, who won the previous election on a KJP ticket, is trying his luck on the Congress ticket this time. Mr Patil wanted to join the BJP as he had quit the Congress on the eve of the 2013 Assembly election to protest against the 'stranglehold' of Mr Kharge and Mr Singh on the Congress. But before he could join the saffron party, Mr Guttedar, who was in the JD(S), staged a coup of sorts by joining the BJP, thus upstaging the plans of Mr Patil. Mr Guttedar has won the seat thrice in 1994 (KCP), 1999 and 2008 (both JDS) and is testing the waters again on a BJP ticket this time. In Jewargi, sitting Congress MLA Dr Ajay Singh will have a tough time as he is going to face the elections without his father, who had the knack of winning over people. Taking on Dr Singh will be Doddappagowda Patil Naribol of the BJP and Mr Kedarlingaiah Hiremath of the JD(S). In Sedam, Medical Education Minister Dr Sharanprakash Patil is sitting pretty. Although the BJP has not yet finalised its candidate, its former district president Rajkumar Telkur is likely to be given a final chance. He has lost to Dr Patil thrice so far. In the reserved Chincholi constituency, the fight will be between sitting Congress MLA Dr Umesh Jadhav and former Minister Sunil Valyapure, who will be the BJP candidate. The Rashtrakutas, the Bahmani kings and then the Mughals, Kalaburagi's rich history- evident from the numerous ancient monuments dotting the district- is intertwined with political strife. There may be just nine seats up for grabs but this is the land of Veerendra Patil, Kharge and Dharam Singh-all stalwarts who etched their names in state politics and had to rise to the heights through toil and struggle warding off the challenge from less worthy politicians. And for this very reason, anyone expecting to make it quick and fast to the state assembly, riding on money or muscle power like in most polls, is surely in for a rude shock.

But with 4 to 5 months the roads have developed more than 20,000 potholes, reported Kannada Prabha. The heavy rains have exposed the huge scam of misappropriation in BBMP alleged BJP Bengaluru Spokesman N R Ramesh. He has lodged complaints with Lokayukta, Enforcement Directorate and Anti-corruption Bureau, against the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Ministers K J George and H C Mahadevappa and other officials. Speaking at a press meet on Wednesday he released documents pertaining to misappropriation of funds in asphalting and alleged that the new 707 km long roads are totally destroyed. For various developmental projects Rs 7300 crore has been released. Of this Rs 2,075 crore are earmarked for roads. The money has been spent but the quality of civil works is extremely poor he said.  The Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Minister K J George have received huge kickbacks from contractors. Minister H C Mahadevappa and PWD Additional Chief Secretary Mahendra Jain also have played major roles, he said. TVCC Report has stated that Rs15.20 crore misappropriation of funds has been noted in filling up pot holes through Python machines. To fill up potholes in main roads Rs 16.88 crores are spent. From PWD 217.43 km roads are repaired at Rs 227.74 crore and for 490 km Rs 756.11 crore are spent. All the roads are destroyed due to poor quality work. For every km there are 29 to 30 potholes. The Dr Balagangadharanathaswamy flyover repaired at a cost of Rs 5 to 6 crores is in bad condition within 2 months. The government has appointed Empowered Committees to directly take kick back commissions and restricted all powers of the BBMP. The Empowered Committee is actually a murder of democracy, he said. By doing this the government has thrown all rules, regulations to the wind. The Empowered Committees are quoting 30 percent to 62 percent excess amounts, he said. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 14 Sep, 9.03 am

They added that even Russian girls come to Jammu for high profile clients and on special occasions, girls from some other international destinations are brought to Jammu. They further said that the high profile flesh trade racket is running in Jammu and it is not possible to run either drug trafficking racket or prostitution cells without the involvement of top officials. About the prostitution in the lower income groups, sources said that the illegal flesh trade racketeers have contact with the Auto-rickshaw drivers who act as middleman and bring clients to them on commission basis besides they use their auto rickshaw for travelling with clients as those drivers are well versed with the safe routes of the city.

To the strains of a popular Hindi film song ' Dil diya hain jaan bhi denge' from the 1986 hit Karma, he improvised the lyrics to add, 'Maine socha Tripura ko sarvasrestha rajya banana hain', (I thought of making Tripura the best state in the country). The audience was much amused. This bit harmless eccentricity pales before some of Deb's other gaffes: Stating that the Chabimura rock carvings by the Gomti river in the state were 'better' than Amazon, he reportedly said, 'Under our government, the Chabimura tourist spot will become like the Amazon river basin of Africa.' In the run-up to the last assembly elections, Deb, then the state BJP chief, said at a rally in Khowai district that any vote cast in the EVMs for the CPI (M), even by the then chief minister Manik Sarkar, would go to the BJP.  Deb's claim came at a time when there was a raging debate across the country over possible EVM tampering. Several complaints were filed against his comment with the Election Commission of India (ECI), leading him to pipe down, and saying his comment was taken 'out of context.' Now he has topped it all by declaring that the Internet existed in this land long before it was invented in the West. 'It is this country where communication was possible because we then had technology, Internet was there; so was the satellite communication system. It is not that internet and media wasn't available in the age of Mahabharata,' the Tripura chief minister said at a regional workshop on computerisation and reforms in the public distribution.The lampooning in the Internet — the modern one — was severe. Last month when Deb was sworn in as chief minister, he had raised hopes among many of better avenues of employment and development in the state than in the earlier Left Front regime — as promised in the Bharatiya Janata Party''s 28-page 'vision document'. But after winning initial public approval for taking some quick decisions, such as handing over cases of alleged murder of two journalists prior to the assembly polls to the Central Bureau of Investigation and setting up a committee to look into the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations for state government employees, Deb's bizarre statements have been hitting the headlines and have made him a laughing stock both in the state and outside. The Tripura Chief Minister with journalists at the Agartala Press Club on the occasion of Bengali New Year last week. Credit: Twitter/Biplab Kumar Deb The young BJP leader, who served as an RSS volunteer in Delhi for 15 years before returning to the state in 2015 to work for the party, has joined the likes of Union minister of state Satyapal Singh when he referred to Sanjaya, the charioteer in the Mahabharata, and claimed that he could narrate the goings-on in the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas in Kurukshetra to the blind king Dhritarashtra in Ayodhya because Internet and satellites existed then. 'I do not know what happened in the middle age though, between the Mahabharata era and now,' he added. But now, with a prime minister who was active on social networking sites, the entire country had once again got familiar with technology after 2014, said Deb. While both conventional and social media took a few digs at Deb's outrageous claims, he got support from the state's governor, former BJP West Bengal chief Tathagata Roy who jumped to his defence and added his bit on Twitter. Roy tweeted, 'Tripura Chief Minister's observations about the happenings of the Puranic period are topical. It is virtually impossible to conceive of devices like 'Divya dristi', Pushpaka Ratha', etc. without some kind of prototype and study thereon.' Tripura Chief Minister's observations about the happenings of the Puranic period are topical. It is virtually impossible to conceive of devices like 'Divya drishti',Pushpaka Ratha',etc without some kind of prototype and study thereon — Tathagata Roy (@tathagata2) April 18, 2018  Twitteratti went into a tizzy, lapping up these bizarre statements, with some even asking Roy 'to get well soon'. Undeterred by the criticism, Deb, who trained under veteran RSS leaders Govindacharya and Krishna Gopal, instead of stepping back, reiterated what he had said. Accusing those flaying him for his comments as 'narrow minded people who want to belittle their own nation and think highly of other countries', Deb told the local media, 'Every Indian should have a common thinking that India is best and superior country all around the world.' He said his critics should 'accept the truth and should not get confused.' His comments are now legion. Last month, speaking at the Tripura Central University, he said he wanted to see the institution grow like the Nalanda and went on to claim that Chanakya taught at the ancient university situated in present-day Bihar. Not just that, Chanakya taught at Taxila, the ruins of which are found in present-day Pakistan. This past April 18, taking part at an event in Agartala Town Hall, the chief minister also claimed the famous Chinese traveller Hieun Tsang who visited India in the ancient times was a journalist. But it was his Internet claim that has made him a national figure. A day after defending his Internet argument, Deb, interacting with reporters, sought some time to fulfill his 'dreams' for Tripura. But not before sharing another loaded gem from his book of wisdom: 'A person who is not a good homemaker, can't keep his own family happy, can never make the country happy, can't be a good chief minister, neither can he be a good prime minister.'

A petition was filed in the Gujarat high court last year complaining that the candidates falling under the reserved category were being subjected to injustice by the public service commission. The applicant claimed that state authorities were purposely not filling in the vacancies that are for those who fall under the reserved category and instead were using laws to ensure that these vacancies too go to the general category applicants. The high court demanded an answer from the state, who, in November, asked for a period of three months to respond. After the time period lapsed and the court began its hearings again, the state government asked for more time.  This didn't go down well with Justice Paresh Upadhyay, who in a terse tone, ticked off the government saying the high court believes the state and the advocate general are purposely not ensuring implementation of the provisions of reservation. And if it is unable to get the provisions implemented properly, the state should consider having the president's rule over it. This statement from the Gujarat high court comes at a time when pitched battles were fought across the state in the recent times over the burning issue of reservations.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/hyderabad+all+set+for+spanish+football+camp-newsid-78171759| Sports Hyderabad all set for Spanish football camp |  Hyderabad: Hyderabad's footballers are geared up for the Spanish connection. Starting Sunday, youngsters will get a chance to imbibe skills and techniques from the footballing powerhouse as Albert Viñas Aliau, Director of Smart Football, Salou in Catalonia, sets about sifting talent from the City in a four-day camp titled First Goal. As a build-up, city-based Sports Village is organising a free interactive session and field time with the coaches on Saturday at the GMC Balayogi Stadium in Gachibowli from 9 am to 1 pm. Students of all reputed schools, colleges and youth from football academies can take part in it. "Good coaches, adequate facilities and regular competitions are a must to develop football in the country. I hope India will participate in the World Cup finals in future and some players on the team will be from Telangana," Albert said on Friday.  For starters, he will "check the boys out and get a feel of the situation." "The most important aspect of football is what you don't see - the brain. The physique is not as important as the tactic. Spanish international Andres Iniesta is the best example of it - he's not a strong or a fast player but an intelligent one," Albert explained. At his academy in Catalonia, "training is centered around a player's brain, which is the genesis of the popular Spanish quick-passing style tiki-taka. We want the players thinking all through for when they have the ball, they have a millisecond to make a decision after swiftly analysing their teammates, opponents and the situation."   "We will try and help India progress in football. It took us many years to develop this methodology and could be transferred to India in the next five years," Albert said, adding "Sports Village is our partner in South India and has exclusivity to our projects." The Catalonian international academy at Salou has trainees from the world over including five from India. With 11 football fields and resort accommodation for the trainees it is the biggest facility in Spain. "I have been the Academy's director for 20 years now and some of the coaches handling top-tier teams in Spain and Germany are my students, so also a few players in those leagues," Albert said.

He claimed that he is suspicious about the involvement of Pakistan in the case.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi organised a candle march in the protest of Kathua rape case and appealed to the prime minister that daughters in the country are not safe. 2. After the protest on India gate, CBI reached to MLA Kuldeep Sengar and detained him for Unnao rape case. 3. Later Women and child development minister said in a statement that "Am deep, deeply disturbed by the rape case in Kathua, and all the recent rape cases. I and the ministry intend to bring an amendment to the POCSO Act asking for the death penalty for the rape of children below 12 years of age". 4.Father of Kathua rape case victim Muhammad Yusuf Pujawala said " I miss my daughter every day. Those responsible for killing my daughter should be hanged till death". 5. The J&K director general of police said "It is a very heinous crime, it can't get worse than this.

According to Suvarna News , DCP Ajay Hilori had tapped the conversation between his senior Additional Commissioner Charan Reddy and Karnataka Rakshana Vedike president Narayan Gowda. During the Cauvery agitation, DCP Ajay Hilori had arrested one of the KRV members Kannada Prakash. Apparently, following a request made by KRV president Narayangowda, senior officer Charan Reddy had asked DCP Hilori not to arrest Kannada Prakash.  But violating the Police Book rules to the wind, DCP Ajay Hilori had not only tapped the conversation but also allegedly leaked it. It is said that alleged infighting between the senior officers was the reason behind it. Senior officer Charan Reddy has brought this to the notice of Director General of Police RK Datta and the latter has directed City Police Commissioner Praveen Sood to investigate. But even after three notices, Sood has not taken up the matter against DCP Hilori. Sources said Sood's attempt to protect officer Hilori has not gone down well with other officers.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/u4uvoice-epaper-uvoice/jio+phone+s+android+version+coming+soon+5+things+to+know-newsid-75651122| Home Jio Phone's Android Version Coming Soon? 5 Things to Know | Yesterday came a report that Reliance Jio is killing the JioPhone and instead going to focus on a new phone, which will be cheap or even possibly "effectively free", that will run Android. In contrast the JioPhone runs on a version of Firefox OS - KaiOS is what Jio calls it. Although it is lightweight, the problem with the current JioPhone is that it can't run popular apps like WhatsAppp and Facebook. The report yesterday by FactorDaily noted that there is a rethink within Jio about its 4G feature. The report noted that Jio has halted the production of the JioPhone. Yes, the JioPhone is free. Or rather, it is effectively free. But if it can't run the apps that many people want, it may not help the company push it. Hours after the Factor Daily report came and other people started writing about the supposed end of JioPhone, the company came out with a statement. It said:  "JioPhone, India ka smartphone, is committed to fulfilling the country's digital vision. Jio welcomes the initial 6 million Indians who are moving to digital life with the JioPhone and will soon announce the next JioPhone booking date," said the spokesperson. So what does it mean? You must have seen many reports, based on this statement, saying that JioPhone production has not been halted. But that is interpreting this statement. It is not clearly mentioned that JioPhone production has not been halted in Jio statement. In fact, the statement is very vague.  To read between the lines, here is what we think is happening:  - There is indeed a rethink within Jio about the future of the JioPhone and strong chances are that a decision has been taken to alter the course. This is the reason why the JioPhone bookings were halted suddenly in August and since then have not been opened again. That is nearly two months since then, and yet Jio has not started the bookings. - The current focus within the company seems to be delivering the JioPhone that were booked earlier. - It is possible that after fulfilling these orders Jio may have a few more units of JioPhone with it. To sell them, the company may announce a limited booking process again. This could the reason why the Jio statement talks of next JioPhone booking date. - Nothing is final yet within Jio. It's just that they are thinking of the future direction for the JioPhone and are seemingly leaning towards Android for the future variant of the JioPhone as it will allow to run the apps that people want to run as well as compete with the likes of the Karbonn A40 Indian, Micromax Bharat 2 and Celkon Smart 4G that other telecom operators have announced along with bundled data plans. - It is important to note that if there is a pivot within Jio about the JioPhone, it doesn't mean end of JioPhone. It will only mean end of the JioPhone 4G feature phone. This is the reason why the Jio statement notes that "JioPhone, India ka smartphone, is committed to fulfilling the country's digital vision". This JioPhone can be any other. Jio can very well call the next version of device, which uses Android, with the same JioPhone name. - Just to summarise: The fact is that JioPhone rollout has been very slow. It was announced in July. It was opened to pre-booking for just a few days in August. Deliveries started just now for all the phones that were pre-booked, and even now most people haven't got it. It is clear that within Jio there are a few things that are holding the JioPhone back. Now we have a report that the company actually wants to move to a lean smartphone instead of 4G feature phone. The report makes a lot of sense, even though Jio's statement re-affirming its commitment to the JioPhone is not wrong.     Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 01 Nov, 2.25 am

Mind you, these mums are super hot and inspiring. Some of them even stayed single out of choice and adopted children rather than having one of their own.  Before I begin with the list, I would like to appreciate all the single parents who are going strong as ever.    Kudos to you all!   Karisma married industrialist Sanjay Kapur in 2003. The couple had two children together but circumstances changed their equation and they decided to part ways. Their divorce was finalised in 2016 and since then Karisma is taking care of her children. She is mommy goals for all. We salute her spirit.    Sushmita Sen has been a single mother since she decided to adopt a daughter in 2000 and a second girl in 2010. The actress might not be that active on the screen but she supports a lot of social causes.   Read further and you will witness many renowned names.    Shweta who has starred in films like Aabra Ka Daabra and Madhoshi was married to Raja Chaudhary. The couple was blessed with a daughter Palak. Soon, they got divorced in 2007. After six years of taking up all the responsibilities as a single mother Shweta tied the knot with actor Abhinav Kohli. Last year, she was again blessed with a child and this time it was a baby boy.  She is a part of this list because even though that phase of her life has surpassed, she handled everything like a pro.  Note: A few other names on the list are if not directly, then indirectly related to Bollywood.    Kanika got recognition after lending her voice to the most epic dance number of Bollywood 'Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan'. She married Raj Chandok in 1997. The duo was blessed with three beautiful children Aayana, Yuvraj and Samara. The couple got divorced in 2012 and since then Kanika has been taking care of her children single-handedly.   The next slide has a known name but the picture will give you throwback vibes.    Amrita married the Nawab Saif Ali Khan and we all know that the duo was blessed with two super amazing children. But, after thirteen years of togetherness, they had to split in the year 2004. Amrita stood up as a strong woman and endured the tests of time. She is an inspiration to all those single mothers who wish to make something of their own.   Daughter of Kabir Bedi, Pooja is a strong and independent mother. She got married to Ebrahim in 1990 but after ten years of togetherness, they called it quits. Pooja lives with her children in Mumbai and they support her a lot in all walks of life.   Read further to know about Shruti Haasan's mother.    One of the hottest mommies on the list is here. Malaika is a mom to a fourteen-year-old but doesn't look like one. She married Arbaaz Khan in 1998 but recently the couple got divorced. After that, Malaika has been handling the responsibilities of a parent all by herself. She surely is a brave woman with all her strength and sensibility at one place.   Sarika ji married superstar Kamal Haasan and gave birth to two amazing daughters Shruti and Akshara. Soon things started to get bitter and the couple decided to file a divorce. Since then, she has been taking care of her daughters and this has never changed the equation of the girls with their father. She is a perfect example of how patience and courage can take you a long way.   The last person on our list (after Sussanne) is my personal favourite. You all must read about her.    Sussanne married the Greek god of Indian cinema Hrithik Roshan in 2000. She is also the daughter of famous actor Sanjay Khan and Zarine Katrak and that is how she is associated with Bollywood. The couple has two sons namely Hrehaan and Hridhaan. We are not sure as to what happened between the couple but they silently got divorced. Even after this episode, they are seen spending time with their kids. We are happy that things haven't turned bitter for them and Sussanne has handled everything with her usual grace and smartness.   The actress starred in SRK's film Raees. Mahira has a cute son named Azlan and she happens to embrace motherhood as a single parent like no one else. She is a perfect example of never giving up on anything especially the ones we love. We salute her and others on this list.  That's all people.  Like and share the story.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/oneindia-epaper-oneindia/what+did+modi+say+about+opposition+s+criticism+and+his+silence+on+allegations-newsid-86030884| Latest What did Modi say about opposition's criticism and his silence on allegations | Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke his heart out during the 'Bharat Ki Baat, Sabke Saath' event at Central Hall in Westminster, London, on Wednesday evening. Modi spoke on myriad subjects during the interactive session, which lasted for around three hours. It was unlike any other diaspora events which have become a hallmark of PM Modi everytime he travels abroad. The event in London was an interactive one and the PM took questions from the audience during the session which was anchored by renowned lyricist Prasoon Joshi. From Kathua rape to surgical strikes, the Prime Minister spoke with flair and clarity, and it all seemed to be coming from his heart. He touched upon history, spoke on the need to embrace the latest technology and recounted the achievements of his government in many areas in the last 4 years.  Although he did not name the Congress, his references would clearly leave the grand old party irked. He said history was not portrayed in a correct manner after the independence, adding that 'only one family was not responsible for the independence'. These remarks would definitely leave the Congress fuming. When asked about criticism and scathing attacks by the opposition, PM Modi said that criticism is like a 'gold mine' which is needed in a democracy. 'Criticism is the essence of democracy. A healthy criticism is good for democracy. I am grateful to those criticising me, it is a gold mine. It gives me a chance to introspect,' he said. The Prime Minister tried to explain the difference between a healthy criticism and needless allegations. 'A criticism is good when it is done after a thorough research. Allegations for the sake for criticism are not good for the country. A good criticism needs solid research work, it has to be backed by data. Just talking in the air is not criticism,' he added. Modi then said that many a times opposition points fingers at his silence and accuse him of not reacting to certain important happenings. He said he does not speak to silence others. He said if the opposition accuses him of something, then he takes note of it and does what needs to be done. Modi said he believes in listening and acts based on it, adding, 'Why should I speak to silence others.' source: oneindia.com  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 10.23 am2 days ago7 days ago2 days ago7 days ago2 days ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/us+wants+to+continue+expanding+defence+security+ties+with+india+official-newsid-86038170| America US wants to continue expanding defence, security ties with India: official |  Washington: The Trump Administration plans to continue to expand its defence and security cooperation with India and support New Delhi's growing relationships throughout South Asia, a top US official has said. Speaking with PTI, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells said the US-India strategic partnership was based on a shared commitment to uphold the rule of law and free and fair trade among other things.   "The US-India strategic partnership stands firmly upon a shared commitment to uphold the rule of law, freedom of navigation, democratic values, and free and fair trade. We plan to continue to expand our defence and security cooperation and support India's growing relationships throughout the region," Wells said.  Wells has been running the crucial South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department for more than a year now in the Trump Administration in the absence of an Assistant Secretary of State. Responding to a question on her impression about the India-US relationship in more than a year of the Trump Administration, Wells quoted the US president and said the ties "had never been stronger, never been better". "His words have rung true for me since taking this position last summer. The USA and India, as the world's oldest and largest democracies respectively, collaborate on a broad scope of issues to support the freedom, openness, and peace that have brought so much prosperity Indo-Pacific over recent decades," Wells said. These issues were at the top of her agenda during her recent trip to India, Wells said. She said she was "excited" about the first US-India 2 2 to be held in the coming months. "We are working to identify mutually convenient dates. This engagement will further support our efforts to deepen diplomatic, security, and military cooperation to confront our most pressing global challenges, from Afghanistan and North Korea to the threat of terrorism," Wells said. "We are also focused on strengthening economic ties, including increasing two-way trade, which has more than doubled over the last decade to roughly USD 125 billion," she said. The two countries are also working hard to strengthen their energy partnership, Wells said, adding that Energy Secretary Rick Perry's recent visit to New Delhi for the Strategic Energy Partnership "elevates the role of energy in advancing shared goals". "Our collaboration in oil and gas, renewable, coal, and civil nuclear cooperation is helping to improve India's energy security and support its inclusive development while supporting thousands of US jobs and reducing our trade deficit," Wells said.

The students, on their part, have erupted in protest against this.  A seminar on gender sensitisation was held for the first year students in the college about three weeks ago. The students started sitting together after the seminar much to the dismay of the senior staff members who objected to this.   Nevertheless, the students were not ready to comply by the restriction. Meanwhile, a senior student made a Facebook post criticising the restriction put by the staff.  The department heads, who organised against the mentions in the post, called for a PTA meeting and distributed print-outs of the Facebook post. They also informed the parents about the girls and boys sitting together in classroom.  The college union took over the issue as it became evident that there is going to be severe action against the student who put up the Facebook post.  The college principal has given his word that the incident will be investigated and a solution found, after the union approached the principal. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 15 Dec, 4.34 pm

She complained to the party's Mumbai unit chief Sanjay Nirupam, who promised to take action against those found guilty. The protest march was organised by the party at Juhu.   Nirupam said the woman, who is a district-level party worker, sent a text message to him about the alleged incident.  In her message, the woman said, "The workers of Youth Congress and NSUI (party's students' wing) stooped to such low level that they touched, pushed and shoved women workers in an inappropriate manner, making us feel unsafe among our very own party's male colleagues. "Sadly, some male workers did this to us only to get ahead in the march so that their faces were captured by the media. I want to know if women workers will be safe in similar events held in future?" her text message said. Nirupam said, "This incident is very unfortunate and I condemn it. I told the woman that he would take action if she identifies the persons involved. I told her that if she wished, he would help her file police cases against the accused. But she told me there was too much crowd, so it won't be possible for her to identify them." He said the woman enthusiastically participates in all dharnas and morchas organised by the city unit. "She does not participate alone, but brings along with her over a dozen women members. I have apologised to her for the agony she had to suffer on Sunday. Male workers often rush ahead in any morcha, so that their faces can be seen on television cameras," he said. The Congress leader said he will issue the dos and don'ts to be followed during the protest marches or morcha when women are also participating in large numbers. "If the instructions are not followed, action would be taken," he said. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 19 Apr, 4.51 pm2 weeks ago2 weeks ago7 days ago10 hrs ago2 days ago

Here is why men #HateCondoms | Durex India, which claims to be the best condom brand in India, has tweeted that 95 percent of men in India do not use condoms. This has led to a campaign #HateCondoms and believe me; this is the topmost trending hashtag on Twitter. It is said that the percentage is based on the findings of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). What’s happening India? 95% of Indians don’t use condoms! We’d love to know why?— Durex India (@DurexIndia) March 5, 2018  But do people really hate condoms? Or was the company speaking about people not using the Durex condoms? The Twitterati expressed mixed reactions to this finding. While many found it difficult to believe the numbers, others gave reasons, why men do not like wearing condoms.  However, according to Business Standard report based on the findings of the NFHS in 2017, the use of contraceptive pills and condoms has risen in India even as there has been a decline in adopting overall family planning methods. The statistics by NFHS stated that between the previous survey, 10 years ago, and now, the use of pills has risen to 4.1 percent from 3.1 percent, and that of condoms to 5.6 percent from 5.2 percent. So, what has happened to Indian men in 2018? On the other hand, use of contraceptives by women has gone up to 54%. This might provide some answers to why the number of men using condoms has come down. Men don't like compromising on the sexual pleasures but can order their women to use contraceptives? Is this what's happening? Maybe there is need for a new hashtag #HateCondomsButLoveContraceptives?  Hey does Condoms take the amazing feeling of sex away? I don't think so. Then why so #HateCondoms ?— Oye_Sonali (@Oye_Sonali) March 5, 2018    Mainly because of this fact, you may now think of condoms to be as essential as guns while in combat. #HateCondoms— Pooja (@bindas_pari) March 5, 2018    I #HateCondoms because 40 rs diye condom ke or fatt bhi gaya BC 72 hours wali tablet ke 80 rs or lag gaye🙄😑— डाँ लाडले बाबा (@SonOfChoudhary) March 5, 2018    LOL 95% of Indians don't wear condoms coz it's like chewing on an Eclairs with the wrapper on.

Believe it or not, there were some collateral damages occurred after British left the country and the recent condition of the Maharajas, maharanis, begums, nizams and princesses are dominant examples of them. Their power was revoked; their lands were seized without compensating entailed with the abolition of privy purse. Of late, some of them emerged as powerful politicians and businessmen while other are still struggling to rise above mediocrity. They have lost quite a lot of fortune in this bargain such as selling piles of their gems and jewelleries, fleets in their entirety and became a hostage to debts.  Read some of their stories of Indian royal families descendants : Indian royal families descendants -  1. Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad:  During the 20th century, he was the richest man of the World with approximately a wealth of £100 million in gold and £400 million in jewelry. He even used 185-carat diamond worth $200 million as paperweight and possessed pearls to fill up entire Piccadilly Circus. One of his unfortunate descendant is Mukarram Jah who lives in Istanbul now in a small apartment being afflicted with diabetes.     2. Raja Brajraj Kshatriya Birbar Chamupati Singh, Mahapatra of Tigiria:  He is the last surviving ruler of Odisha who once boasted of 25 luxury cars while living in a palace with 30 servants. He was highly regarded for being a good Shikari who shot about 13 tigers and 28 leopards. All his wealth was gone down the drain when he lost state's tax revenues was slammed with a privy purse of £130 pounds a year instead. In essence, he had to sell his palace and now lives in the mercy of villagers and begs alms.     3. Sultana Begum, wife of the great grandson of Bahadur Shah Zafar:  She now lives on a measly pension with which she supports her 6 children. Sultana's life slithered into poverty since her husband Prince Mirza Bedar Bukht, the great grandson of Bahadur Shah Zafar died in 1980. This queen is now compelled to live in a two-room hut in Kolkata. She even has to share her kitchen with the neighbours and washes in the roadside tap.     4. The Scindias of Gwalior:  The Mughals turned the fort of Gwalior into a prison after the Tomars built it. The castle was a strategic outpost of 1857 rebels until Scindias enjoyed throttlehold on them. This fort was stuffed with the enormous wealth that the Scindias possessed to be used during emergencies and famines. Maharaja Jayajirao Scindia perished suddenly without passing the secret code to the wealth to his son Madavrao Scindia and hence the family went broke and settled in extreme poverty.     5. Ziauddin Tucy, descendant of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor:  He is the sixth generation descendant of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar who lives in extreme poverty now. He has to do odd jobs to make ends meet and beholden to the government to release the properties of the bygone Mughals to the legal legatees. They now survive on a pension of 8000 rupees issues by the government.     6. Uthradam Thirunal Marthanda Varma , the former King of Tranvancore:  By 1750, the king of Travancore dedicated all his wealth to the have-nots and they revolted against the British mutiny in 1839 but lost to them which followed a penalty that ripped them off their 50,000 army, and payment for the upkeep of British regiments. Later when government ordered state protection of the Sri Padmanava Swamy Temple in Thiruvanthapuram where the wealth was dedicated to, they found that the treasure belonged to no one but the temple, as the king ordered leaving his descendants in utter disarray.     7. Descendants of Tipu Sultan:  In Seringapatnam in May on 1799, Tipu Sultan died fighting against the British government and labelled as the 'Tiger of Mysore'. His wealth was plundered by the British and most of his lineage is on the verge of extinction that which forced his descendants to live in dismal impoverishment even though they are heirs to the country's one of the biggest and richest Muslim trusts, Prince Ghulam Muhammad trust.    These are Indian royal families descendants - We were oblivious to this fading royalty of India, the descendants of the erstwhile Nawabs are royals by only in terms of blood connection but their riches are all gone. These instances open our mind to two facts, one- there is no predictability of your fortune, today you are king but you can become a beggar in no time, two- India has been subject to British loot for centuries now, we were not a poor country as they label us, they made us one.

Love is the second name of shah jahan and mumtaz. Shah jahan constructed Taj for his beloved Mumtaz as she died in her 14th child birth. But we are unaware from the facts of the beautiful monument and the people related to it. Here are some unknown and uncommon facts of that era and great emperor Shah Jahan and his beloved Mumtaz.    Taj Mahal was not built and designed to entomb a second person other than Mumtaz Mahal. Aurangzed decided to bury his father's body next to Mumtaz Mehal instead of building another monument for is father.     Shah Jahan was laid next to his beloved wife Mumtaz in Taj Mahal also called as Mumtaz Mehal.    There was no state funeral for Shah Jahan after being a great king also.     Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his younger son Aurangzeb as he was afraid that his father won't give him the throne. Rather the throne would be given to his elder brother. Therefore for the greed of occupying the throne , Shah Jahan was house arrested by his younger son.      Shah Jahan's sons apparently fought a battle called the battle of Samugarh against each other for the crown.      Shah Jahan married mumtaz sister after her death. This is really wondering if he loved her truly.      Mumtaz was his 4th wife and he was already married 7 times. Mumtaz had married another man who was apparently killed by shah jahan so that he can marry mumtaz.      Full name of Shah Jahan as an emperor was "Shahanshah Al-Sultan al-'Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram, Malik-ul-Sultanat, Ala Hazrat Abu'l-Muzaffar Shahab ud-din Muhammad Shah Jahan I, Sahib-i-Qiran-i-Sani, Padshah Ghazi Zillu'llah, Firdaus-Ashiyani, Shahanshah-E-Sultanant Ul Hindiya Wal Mughaliya.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/careguru+english-epaper-creguru/sex+before+marriage+is+a+taboo+in+india+why-newsid-77899287| Sex & Relationships Sex before marriage is a taboo in India. Why? |   India is considered to have one of the World's oldest and the most diverse cultures. India's languages, religions, dance, and customs differ from place to place within the country and have a respect for each other. After 100 years of slavery, India got independent and since then it didn't look back in the development. It has the fastest growing economy and has a reputed place in the world. We are a part of this great country yet, there are some issues or taboo from which we need to go through and have to respect that.   India, known to be one of the largest democracies in the world has the largest bunch of hypocrites. The hypocrisy is more gender-oriented here than an individual oriented. How can we forget about the important decision by the SC bench in the year 2010 that spoke in favour of live-in-relationships and pre-marital sex? There is no law that considers these two acts of adults as an offence. Lord Krishna was worshipped and respected although he lived with Radha with no formal recognition of the relationship in the society.   Sex before marriage is one of the concerns and Indian society doesn't allow having sex before your marriage. It is matched with the character of a girl who has no dignified character and she is looked down upon. In our country, if a girl loses her virginity before marriage, she will be framed as 'slut', which is used to describe the character of a girl and I don't need to describe the meaning of slut. The height of hypocrisy is seen when, still, in certain parts of our country, on the first night of the wedding, a newly wedded girl's chastity is tested on a white bedsheet. I am sure you know what I mean.       It has been in the society for years and it has been followed even by most educated families too. It is not about the freedom and choice of a girl but it looked like cheating your future husband. It is especially categorised to girls but has no such ritual for boys. Every boy who is ready for a marriage wants a virgin girl but not compared to with how many girls he slept in the past. It is a taboo for a girl but not for a boy as he can lose his virginity. The society doesn't question as men are privileged to make choices.   Sex education is as important as any other subject but still, it is not regular academics in any school. The problem is we as Indians have a problem with the word 'sex'. Whenever we hear this word, it makes us conscious and we don't want to be a part of that conversation. This is how things work in our country. Instead of being a part of the conversation, we rather prefer to talk about it in the selected group of people and even make of it.   Sex education has been pointed out by many Bollywood movies - a few in a subtle way while a few in the most candid way. We loved the movies " Piku " and "Pink" but let's come to the point. Can we expect all dads of the society to be as liberal as Amitabh Bachchan in Piku who indicated to his daughter's 'prospected' boyfriend that she was not a virgin?   Pink was a film that devastated the whole concept of choice by women versus choice by men. We accept and learn the lessons from movies but fail to apply that in our day to day lives.   As a girl, if you bring a guy friend to your house, they will ask about the relationship status or how serious is the relationship and the best question just comes after that, did you think about marrying the same guy? Everybody has the freedom to choose or to have sex with and it should not be limited to your future husband even if you will marry someone or not. It depends on the upbringing of the child and women having sex before marriage is definitely still a taboo among many Indians.   It also depends on where you live, what your religious beliefs are and what you personally believe. There are many western countries where people generally lose their virginity at the age of 15-17 and in India, stats are changing as more than 50 per cent of Indian population are below 25 and 49 per cent of them are in a relationship. So before getting married, they are maintaining a relationship and it is obvious that they had or will have some moments. Things are changing and we as a part of this country should reconsider or thoughts. It is still a taboo for girls and if it is then it should be for boys as well. It is not about losing your virginity but it is about finding the right person.   I condemn the act of hypocrisy and orthodoxy around pre-marital sex. A woman can go through marital rape but can't be made love to before marriage. A man wants to marry a virgin although he has never had that record of the same.   How do we know that a woman who had never had sex before marriage is a human being with a heart of gold? Sex is a choice and should be left to be chosen by adults. Like the menstruation and nightfall in women and men the urge to have sex is normal. Why suppress one and be tagged with names that no parents would like to call their children.

Placards reading 'Modi go home' and 'we stand against Modi's agenda of hate and greed' were held up by the noisy demonstrators near Downing Street and the British parliament as Modi arrived for talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May. The horrific gangrape and killing of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu's Kathua was the main focus of the demonstration, though a few other causes were also highlighted.  Many supporters of the prime minister came out to the streets too. There were two distinct camps - several groups that were against the Indian prime minister and the government for a variety of reasons, from demanding Khalistan to those protesting the murder of rationalists and journalists, and those protesting against the protestors. For the latter, the former groups are 'anti-India' forces. For everyone who protested there were others who supported Modi. Much like in India, the NRI community found itself divided, and the fervour that greeted his visit was tempered by the anger of protestors.  Hundreds of noisy protesters greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he arrived in London on Wednesday. Credit: Ruhi Khan Coaches brought in over a thousand Sikhs from gurudwaras in Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton, Slough and Southall, and they were clearly the largest group protesting against Modi. 'Modi is a butcher, a terrorist,' said Love Sunder Singh Dalewal from the Sikh Federation UK, who had organised these protests. While a Tamil group protested against government policies in the region, two women couldn't stop singing Modi's praises. 'Modi has brought in many changes in the country. We are proud of him,' said Ansuya Gorasia. 'We did not come last time Modiji was here. So we made sure we are here today to show our support,' said Jasoda Wagjiani. A couple originally from Jammu that has been living in London for several years now said, 'We have been living for 70 years in a war-like situation and we want it to be resolved. We want peace and harmony in the most beautiful country in India,' said Lalit Sharma. 'We are very confident that Modiji can resolve it. We love him,' added Sana Sharma.  Hundreds of noisy protesters greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he arrived in London on Wednesday. Credit: Ruhi Khan Some Kashmiri groups staged their protests against Modi both through presentations and through letters to the foreign secretary. The gangrape and murder of the girl in Kathua was picked up by many to make their point that 'religious fanaticism displayed in the behaviour by these communal elements has threatened the peace and harmony of the region,' according to Javid Kakroo, a Kashmiri community activist. A group of 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (Save Girls, Educate Girls)' campaigners, primarily from the vast Gujarati diaspora in Britain, were full of praise for Modi. 'The message 'save the girl child' is close to my heart. It's been perceived that Indian women are not active in adventure activities, and I am keen to break that perception through my journey,' said Bharulata Patel-Kamble, solo car driver. Flash mobs broke out dancing to the song of 'Indiawala' and many, dressed in traditional attire, proudly stood in support of Modi. The Indian Ladies in London group created a box wherein people could submit questions which they hoped to ask the prime minister during his visit. Hundreds of people have responded with questions in person and on social media over the past month. 'We want better lives for women and we believe Modi can do that in India,' said Uma Parvati of the group. Another women's group that stood in white in solidarity with the brutalised child and other rape victims told The Wire, 'Women, strangers and friends from all walks of life, all age groups put up a poignant protest against the recent upsurge of rapes of little girls in India. The protest was apolitical and the women stood strong in their silence,' said Nabanita Sircar, a journalist protesting. The prime minister, on his part, addressed the recent incidents of rapes of minor girls in India at the 'Bharat Ki Baat, Sabke Saath' programme held the same day at the iconic Central Hall Westminster here. Modi called violence against women an evil of not just the individual but also of society. He said, 'we always ask our daughters about what they are doing, where they are going. We must ask our sons too. The person who is committing these crimes is also someone's son. He has a mother too in his house.' Modi also took a dig at the previous governments and said days of incremental change are over and Indians have become more and more aspirational under the BJP-led government at the Centre. He added that people have more expectations from his government because they know that it can deliver. 'People know that when they say something, the government will listen and do it. Days of incremental change are over,' Modi said, responding to a series of questions anchored by Prasoon Joshi, chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification. On his government's criticism by opposition parties, Modi said his problem is not with criticism. 'To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts. Sadly, it does not happen now. What happens instead is allegations,' he said. 'I want this government to be criticised. Criticism makes democracy strong. Democracy cannot succeed without constructive criticism,' he added.

However, some film fraternity members dismissed it as a "feminist debate". Swara believes "Padmaavat" has brought up the question whether women-widowed, raped, young, old, pregnant, pre-pubescent-have the right to live. In an open letter published on The Wire late on Saturday, Swara has decried glorification of self-immolation customs Sati and Jauhar. She began her note by congratulating Bhansali for being able to release "Padmaavat" despite the hurdles-something she says she even fought trolls for on social media.  The actress, who played a small part in Bhansali's "Guzaarish", watched "Padmaavat" first day, first show", and decided to share her concerns as it left her "stunned". "That's what I felt like at the end of your magnum opus. I felt like a vagina. I felt reduced to a vagina-only. "I felt like all the 'minor' achievements that women and women's movements have made over the years - like the right to vote, the right to own property, the right to education, equal pay for equal work, maternity leave, the Vishakha judgment, the right to adopt children. All of it was pointless; because we were back to basics. "We were back to the basic question-of right to life. Your film, it felt, had brought us back to that question from the Dark Ages - do women - widowed, raped, young, old, pregnant, pre-pubescent. do they have the right to live?" Swara wrote. She stressed: "Women have the right to live, despite being raped sir. Women have the right to live, despite the death of their husbands, male 'protectors', 'owners', 'controllers of their sexuality'. whatever you understand the men to be. Women have the right to live - independent of whether men are living or not. "Women have the right to live. Period. It's actually pretty basic," she wrote, referring to the "very uncomfortable" climax scene in which actress Deepika Padukone (Rani Padmavati in "Padmaavat") leads a pack of women to commit self-immolation after attackers venture into their kingdom and kill the men. "Women are not only walking talking vaginas. Yes, women have vaginas, but they have more to them as well." Swara said she was hopeful that Bhansali would offer "some sort of a critique of Sati and Jauhar in your film". The daughter of well-known strategic analyst C. Uday Bhaskar and professor of film studies Ira Bhaskar, signed off the letter as "Swara Bhaskar, Desirous of Life". Her lengthy post did not resonate well with actress-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, who tweeted: "Aren't these feminist debates on 'Padmaavat' rather dumb? It's a story ladies - not an advocacy of Jauhar for God's sake. Find another battle for your cause-a real one at all. Not historical fiction." Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit wrote: "This is nothing but trying to grab eyeballs with zero rationale and logic. Swara Bhaskar has reduced a queen of brain and might to just a female body part. Does more harm to feminism than good." Producer Manish Mundra commented: "Now somebody takes fiction seriously and writes open letter about a story 100s of years old. The point is if you make a film from your past, do changes suitably to reflect today's feminism. "Both are in same boat-those who think a film can change their history and those who think a fictional film from past should be changed suitably to represent today's feminism."

The College clarified that the professor had been suspended and an inquiry has been launched, however, the shocking clip has raised questions about the occurrence of soliciting on campus. While the professor, Nirmala Devi, a faculty member of Mathematics Department from Devanga Arts College, agrees that it is her voice on the clip she says that her words had been misconstrued. In the clip, she can be heard speaking to four students, asking them if they will consider doing a "big assignment". She says that doing so would help them get financial and academic support.  Here is the chilling transcript of the conversation- 1. I'm someone who knows everyone's secrets. So far we have shared a teacher-student relationship, now we have the chance to take it to the next level. 2.I have always supported you with regard to academics, now there is a big opportunity but it is something that we have to do in secret. If you do this, things on the academic front will change drastially for you without any difficulty. That is how high the officials involved in this assignment are. 3. What you have to do is complete "something" for them successfully. I can't go into more details but I trust you'll be able to understand. They've been requesting me for a very long time to do this. 4.If this gets out, it'll reflect badly on you. They've given me strong assurance. That's why I'm giving you this opportunity. 5.There is also financial support, more than you can imagine. It is your wish to tell your parents or not, depending on that we can discuss the amount. We will create a bank account and send you the money. 6. You can also pursue distance education or go to evening college, we will help you get into proper research and study. And you will also get a monthly salary. It is not necessary that you do any work. 7.( The students respond by saying they are hoping to get government jobs) Even to get the VC's post, you need influence. So when it comes to TNPSC exams you need influence as well. 8. If you don't like it, you don't have to do it but it's better if you think about it for two days before deciding. Such opportunities don't come easily. 9. There is big assignment coming next week and it involves a very high official. I can't name them but he is a very big official. 10. If you notice a recent video of mine with the 'governor', you can see that I've taken the video from such close quarters. Just by looking at that, you'll know how much influence I have. The clip has sent shockwaves across not just the academic world but the State in general. University officials claim that the issue is an attempt to malign the name of the institute, "This comes in the backdrop of the university constituting an inquiry committee at the level of syndicate sub-committee last month based on the complaints against the college management over misappropriation of UGC funds. The university will lodge a complaint against the college with the SP," the Vice Chancellor, P P Chellathurai said.

"Kapil came to me many a times, I was afraid that how he would handle himself. He was unable to handle his position.

A time has come when I thought that he would do something wrong with his life. Ginni is holding Kapil's life."  "If something wrong happens in Kapil's life, than I will not be responsible for this. I am very scared of this thought. I think, he needs serials medical help because he is mentally sick. "    Kapil Sharma took to Twitter and posted a copy of the complaint filed by him against the three of them. He captioned it, "Some people just want to defame you for few bucks, but it will take ages to take a stand against the wrong .I shall do it today n forever."

Read Menaka Bhandary's #PassionToPaycheck story below.  Menaka Bhandary always knew she would become an entrepreneur. She displayed her precocity at 13, washing cars in her neighbourhood along with a group of friends. "We were shocked at the number of cars we were washing in a day and ecstatic about the summer holiday pocket money we generated. Then later, at 16, I held a jewellery exhibition with a friend, where we used our networking skills and connected with friends of our parents, Bangalore Club members, ex-teachers and others to ensure that we make the sale a success," she recalls.  She then worked for other businesses for about seven years before striking out on her own in December 2017 by launching BLOWN, a niche space dedicated to blow drying, cutting, colouring and styling hair as well as nail art and makeup.  Initial experience  A Bangalorean at heart, Menaka, a Christ University Arts graduate, joined as a sales executive at Zela Health Clubs, where she moved up to managing the marketing department, and even ended up completing a certification as a spinning instructor. "My second job was with the Narang Group where I headed marketing and events in south India. I [dabbled] all areas of the business, till my last stint with the Active Holiday Company, where I managed its business development." Menaka had always been very passionate about the health and fitness space. "My husband pushed me to listen to a podcast on Allie Webb's business, Drybar. I was instantly intrigued by the concept, and was already imagining the experience I would be delivering to my customers," explains Menaka, who decided to explore her options as an entrepreneur.  A different adventure  She believes the grooming industry in India is growing exponentially, with each brand bringing its own USP to the market. The focus is not just the services but building and creating a revolutionary and holistic experience for the consumer." That's exactly what Maneka did with BLOWN. She explains, "Our team of experts is equipped to get you ready to go in a wink; and if you're in no hurry, we house a curated selection of international wines and cocktails to help you unwind. In other words, we love pampering people."    However building a business isn't a cakewalk. Not having a beauty services background was her biggest challenge. "When I approached technicians and stylists who worked with successful brands and invited them to join me, most of them laughed at the concept. They couldn't understand the inclusion of a wine bar at a salon," she says. But today, she is proud of what she's done with BLOWN. She believes it's all because of the passion she has had for entrepreneurship. "One of the things I truly believe in is the ability to accept that you are learning something new every day. Everybody has to start somewhere. If you have something in your mind and have the zeal to execute it, you will find a way to make it work if it's important enough."  The future roadmap   BLOWN is located in one of Bangalore's tony areas where there is tremendous competition. "There are approximately 20 salons in the neighbourhood, so making a mark and finding the differentiating factor was a struggle. This venture being my very first business in a completely new industry, and with big players that customers swear by, meant that I had to deliver something truly exceptional and unique. It also meant that the quality of service that I provide had to be mind-blowing," says Menaka. But manage she did and more. "Acquiring our wine license was a big challenge. I spent days in the Excise Department just trying to get an appointment with the person concerned." And today, she's exactly where she wants to be: running a business successfully. She wants the company to expand further and have a major presence in every Indian city. She's also looking at extending BLOWN to other South-East Asian countries in the near future. "In a male-dominated country like India, it's a huge struggle to run a business as a woman. But I've done everything I can to run my first business successfully, and will continue to do it," says this supremely confident young woman.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news24online-epaper-newsonline/why+exactly+china+hates+dalai+lama+know+the+facts-newsid-65988612| World Why exactly China hates Dalai Lama: Know the facts |  New Delhi: China appears to be very touchy on the Arunachal issue to ascertain its claim on Tibet. China has said time and again that it will nominate the next Dalai Lama who will toe the Chinese line and will agree that Tibet is a part of China. So the present Dalai Lama does not exactly fit the bill for China. Tibetans all across the world revere him as their spiritual leader and cultural icon. The pathological hatred of China for Dalai Lama, who virtually challenges the former's whims and fancy has root in histories.       A celebrity across the world is a hated figure in China:     Dalai Lama may be a celebrated holy figure across the globe but he is a much hated trouble maker in China which considers him a "wolf in holy robe" for challenging the soverignity of China by asking for freedom. But Dalai Lama says that all he is asking for is autonomy to sustain and protect Tibetans' culture and religion. Seen as a rebel who initiated a rebellion against China in Tibet in 1959 after which he sought a political asylum in India.   The cause is in the history of the region:   The monastery in Tawang was built in 1681 by the Tibetan lama Lodre Gyasto complying with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama Nagwang Lobsang. Dalai Lama is the inheritor of the same order and is therefore despised by China. China wants its own choosen Dalai Lama on the holy seat.  Dalai Lama's globe trotting irks China   Though Dalai Lama openly says that he has never demanded for a complete independence from China, the latter feels that he has not given up his dream of a 'Greater Tibet'  and it sees Dalai Lama's global tours as strategies to make lobby and build pressure groups therefore pushing for his political goals. What adds fuel to the fire is the fact that Dalai Lama mostly meets world leaders who are not very good friends of China-- for example the American President and for that matter, even the Indian leaders.  His peaceful initiatives have further isolated China:   Dalai Lama won the Nobel Prize for peace in 1989 further isolating China in the eyes of the world and further putting pressure on it through celebrity endorsements like that of Richard Gere. So indirectly it is the good peace-loving humble Dalai Lama vs the power hungry and strong China. China hates this positioning.  Tibet is a sensitive issue for China:   For China Tibet is a core sensitive issue. And China finds it insulting when Dalai Lama is accorded a VIP treatment akin to the head of a state and it cahllenges China's soverighmity.  The words such as 'freedom' and 'human rights' used by Dalai Lama and his followers to win sympathy world-over is highly objectionable to China. And for India the issue of Tibet and Dalai Lama both  are means to settle scores with China and keep its reins in hand.  News24Buearu  Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 04 Apr, 6.30 pm
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/this+indian+village+practices+a+custom+of+giving+wives+on+rent-newsid-76197889| Home This Indian village practices a custom of giving wives on rent! | India never ceases to amaze. The way we respect, worship, adore, honour our women folk is exemplary in the world. Everybody in the world now knows how despite India having the developed nation tag is still underdeveloped in its outlook towards women. Every now and then arises a story which pushes women and the country back into the dark ages. Here is one such story from a village in Madhya Pradesh. Here women are given out on rent to the richest man or the upper class male who cannot find a partner. The woman is supplied as wife for a month or for yearly rental basis. The words immediately signify how women have been actively reduced to an inanimate object of barter or commerce.  Called Dhadeecha Pratha in the Shivpuri district of MP, the practice involves signing over a woman for lease on a stamp paper. With the help of these stamp deeds worth Rs 10, Rs 100, women are exchanged to the next man in need. There is a market here where girls are made to stand in the name of the custom. Then the men decide the price of the girl of their choice. So the woman has a new husband after her contract ends. The higher the rental amount, the longer the period she gets to stay with one man. This practice is not limited to MP but has been reported in Gujarat as well. Due to scarcity of women largely due to female infanticide, there has been a case where a Gujarati farm labourer Atta Prajapati leased his wife Laxmi to a wealthy zamindar for a month. The exchange earned him 10 times his monthly salary - Rs 8000. The deal needs her to live with the man and share his bed and take care of the family as well. This has become a lucrative business opportunity for many villagers in the Gujarat-MP belt. In some cases the women are sold for prices as low as Rs 500, while in some other their families are paid up to Rs 50,000 for marrying their daughters to men from certain communities. Apart from the dwindling female population here. touts or middlemen who encourage such dealings also prey on the woman's family's poverty. The tribal families are known to be involved in such practices.  No action has been taken because none comes forward to complain, say the police, all the while acknowledging the existence of such a practice. Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 11 Nov, 3.35 pm

Early in the morning today (March 31, 2018) air hostesses of the third largest airline in the country, SpiceJet protested at the Chennai Airport. They alleged that the airline's security staff strip-searched them. The protesting air hostesses alleged that they are being put into uncomfortable situations from past many days. From touching them inappropriately to checking them even when they were menstruating, they have faced it all.  When the investigating journalists spoke to the airlines, they claimed that it is all a part of their security process which is similar to that of the passengers. They called the entire protest baseless.  Here's what the report said: They alleged that it is happening from last few days.   SpiceJet's air hostesses alleged that they were being strip-searched from last few days after they deboarded their flights. The airline has denied all the charges.   The airlines and other staff members insisted that cabin crew's search is the similar to the security check done with other passengers boarding the flight. Kamal Hingorani, SpiceJet's senior vice president blamed the strict search on suspicion of dozens of cabin crew taking cash and company material from flights.  "We have therefore been compelled to carry out spot checks, which in any case is a company policy. It is in all our interests that the 'black sheep' amongst us is identified and removed so that honest employees are not blamed," Kamal Hingorani said in an email to the airline employees. The protecting air hostess shared that they are not allowed to go to the washroom directly after deboarding from flights.  "We air hostesses are stripped naked over the last three days..."  An air hostess with 10 years of experience shared, "We air hostesses are stripped naked over the last three days and women personnel touch us inappropriately. A colleague in her period was asked to remove her sanitary napkin."  "Is this the policy, to remove your sanitary pad, touch private parts?"  NDTV saw some of the complaint emails that were sent by the cabin crew.  "We cabin crew are hired majorly for safety reasons of the fellow passengers but what about our respect and safety? We talk about rape and molestation, is this any less," an email read.  "I'm on my menses she still checked my panty; they pressed my breasts..."   "On informing the base official that I wasn't comfortable and I'm on my menses she still checked my panty; they pressed my breasts. I've lost my self-respect... Cabin crew is the brand ambassador. We are humiliated as if we have done some robbery," one of the air hostesses said in the email.  "It's a baseless allegation," a senior SpiceJet official said.   A senior SpiceJet official in Chennai alleged, "It's a baseless allegation".   "I can't comment. I'm not at the base right now," said another Chennai-based SpiceJet official.

However, women are still considered the weaker gender when it comes to downright fighting or display of physical power. Dr Komal Rao has now proved this notion wrong. The 35-year-old defeated a male opponent in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) in a cage fight in YBN Germany in July 2017. With this, she has allegedly become the first woman in the world to defeat a male opponent in MMA. Komal is the adopted daughter of Dr Seema Rao, India's first woman commando trainer and Major Dr Deepak Rao, a pioneer of close quarter battle.  Komal began learning Jeet Kune Do (JKD), a form of martial arts at the tender age of 15. Today, she is one among the five female instructors in the world certified by Richard Bustillo, student of Bruce Lee. Dr Komal has done her advanced training in JKD under grand master Richard Bustillo. She runs a Mixed Martial Arts Fight Club - Academy of Combat Fitness, reports the New Indian Express. Dr Komal who won by submission in the second round using a rear naked choke, says: "I am the only Indian woman to have fought a male in an MMA cage fight. I have been ranked 22nd in the Pro-MMA Women fighter in Germany and I feel proud about it." Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 24 Sep, 5.43 am

The DC's order, numbered A5/EB/2017-18, was issued on March 24 in this regard. It was claimed by Efficient Brainy that through a super-secret process, children between the age of three and 16 could be turned into geniuses who could read hundreds of pages in a minute, develop astonishing acuity of senses, see things hundreds of miles away and so on. Numerous such centres were opened all over the country, and the owners of these started going around schools with children, who could do many activities with blindfolds on, in tow. These classes would be conducted during holidays and as the process was super secret, no outsiders would be allowed to enter, including the parents. One such centre opened in Puttur and brought out pamphlets claiming that their trained children can do anything with their eyes closed.  Following the same, the FIRA lodged a complaint with the DC. Meanwhile, a team constituted by the DDPI, Mangaluru, visited Efficient Brainy, Puttur, and made a report. The team, in its report, observed that the children do not have any special powers but were just peeking through the gaps between the blindfold and nose.

Drawing a distinction between criticism and allegation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts. Sadly, it does not happen now. What happens instead is allegations. I want this Government to be criticized. Criticism makes democracy strong. Democracy cannot succeed without constructive criticism." The Prime Minister called criticism a "goldmine" that helped him improve himself and correct his mistakes. But why doesn't he respond to the criticism, asked Prasoon Joshi, the adman-lyricist. Joshi, who was last year appointed to head the Chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification, was moderating the session which allowed selected individuals in India and abroad to ask questions. PM Modi acknowledged that there was a charge that he didn't speak up despite "so much criticism". This, he said, happened because he gave the criticism much importance, trying to understand where it was coming from and then rectify his mistakes. "But it is not my job to shut up people who are criticising me, my job is to think where am I going wrong," he said. It was his government's intentions, he said, which were beyond reproach. The explanation comes just a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's predecessor Dr Manmohan Singh advised him to speak more, an irony considering how Narendra Modi would mock the noted economist for his silence in public and derisively called him "Maun' Mohan Singh". Dr Manmohan Singh told The Indian Express on Tuesday that he had the same advice for PM Modi. "I think the Prime Minister should follow his own advice to me and he should speak more often," he said. Other Congress leaders such as Rahul Gandhi have turned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on charges of corruption and nepotism that the opposition levels at him into campaign material for elections. Rahul Gandhi has on numerous occasions attacked the Prime Minister for his silence on celebrity designer Nirav Modi (wanted in fraud cases) slipping out of the country and the Rafale deal. When asked whether he can change the country alone, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was an ordinary citizen just like any other Indian. "We have a million problems but we have a billion solutions," he said. "I can make mistakes but I will not do any work with the ill intention," the Prime Minister said. PM Modi also spoke about crimes against women and asked parties not to politicise the heart-wrenching incidents. Attacking earlier governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said days of incremental change are over and Indians have become more and more aspirational under the BJP-led government at the Centre. PM Modi said people have more expectations from his government because they know that it can deliver. "People know that when they say something, the Government will listen and do it. Days of incremental change are over," the Prime Minister said. During the 130-minute interaction, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Indian community on several issues ranging from surgical strikes to toilets to how he thinks his government's performance should be evaluated.

Photo by: Deepak Malik / IPL/ SPORTZPICS Sunrisers Hyderabad continued their winning run this season with an emphatic 5-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders. Set a modest total of 139, Sunrisers Hyderabad were off to an ideal start. Shikhar Dhawan and Wriddhiman Saha added a quickfire 32 off just 18 ball before Sunil Narine dismissed the latter. In his next over, Narine struck again to remove the in-form Dhawan, helping Knight Riders crawl their way back. At the end of the powerplay, the Sunrisers were 46 for 2 with skipper Kane Williamson and Manish Pandey taking charge of the chase.  Kuldeep Yadav then put the hosts on top by dismissing Pandey to leave the tourists reeling at 55 for 3. At the end of ten overs, Sunrisers were 62 for 3. Williamson and Shakib Al Hasan calmed down the nerves in the dressing room. It looked like the Sunrisers would get home easily when Williamson and Shakib were batting. However, the game turned on its head when both of them departed in quick succession, leaving their side reeling at 119 for 5. The equation was finally down to 13 off the last two overs. Yusuf Pathan and Deepak Hooda then took the team home with 6 balls remaining. Earlier in the game, the Knight Riders lost wickets at regular intervals and ended up with a sub-par score. The experiment to promote Robin Uthappa as opener backfired as he was out for just 3. Chris Lynn and Nitish Rana steadied the ship for a while with a 39-run stand. The stand was broken by Billy Stanlake when he had Rana. The floodgates opened when Shakib Al Hasan dismissed Sunil Narine for 9 with the scoreboard reading 79. From there on, the hosts kept on losing wickets at regulars as they could manage only 138 for 8 in the allotted 20 overs. Lynn top-scored for the home side, scoring 49 off 34. Shubman Gill at 7.

Some excerpts: Nationwide outrage over the brutal gangrape and murder of a minor girl in J&K's Kathua, another similar incident has come to light from Gujarat's Surat, police confirmed rape of another girl with 86 injury marks earlier this month. Shows that the Government has failed in performing the most basic of the responsibilities given to it by the people.    We write to you not just to express our collective sense of shame and not just to give voice to our anguish or lament and mourn the death of our civilizational values - but to express our rage. Rage over the agenda of division and hate your party and it's innumerable, often untraceable offshoots that spring up from time to time, have insidiously introduced into the grammar of our politics, our social and cultural life and even our daily discourse. It is that which provides the social sanction and legitimacy for the incidents in Kathua and Unnao."     It is the culture of majoritarian belligerence and aggression promoted by the Sangh Parivar which emboldened rabid communal elements to pursue their perverse agenda. They knew that their behavior would be endorsed by the politically powerful and those who have made their careers by polarising Hindus and Muslims across a sectarian divide."    "But even more reprehensible that such abuse of power, it is the response of the State Government in hounding the victim of rape and her family instead of the alleged perpetrator that shows how perverted governance practices have become. That the Government of UP finally acted only when it was compelled to do so by the High Court, shows its hypocrisy and the half-heartedness of its intent."    Given your supremacy within the party and the centralized control you and your Party President exercise, you more than anyone else have to be held responsible for this terrifying state of affairs. Instead of owning up and making reparations, however, you had until yesterday chosen to remain silent, breaking your silence only when public outrage both in India and internationally reached a point when you could no longer ignore it."    You have not condemned the communal pathology behind the act nor shown the resolve to change the social, political and administrative conditions under which such communal hate is bred. We have had enough of these belated remonstrations and promises to bring justice when the communal cauldron is forever kept boiling by forces nested within the Sangh Parivar.  Reach out to the families of the victims in Unnao and Kathua and seek their forgiveness on behalf of all of us.  1. Fast-track the prosecution of the perpetrators in the Kathua case and request for a Court directed SIT in the Unnao case, without further ado. 2. In the memory of these innocent children and all other victims of hate crime, renew a pledge to offer special protection to Muslims, to Dalits, to members of other minority communities, to women and children so that they need not fear for their life and liberty and any threat to these will be extinguished with the full force of State authority. 3. Take steps to remove from Government anyone who has been associated with hate crimes and hate speeches. 4. Call for an All Party Meeting to deliberate on ways in which the phenomenon of hate crime can be tackled socially, politically and administratively.

Shanthinagara MLA NA Haris during the inauguration of a sub-main pipeline at Neelasandra LR Nagar bridge (Photo: Facebook)  Bengaluru:  The long wait seems to be over for Congress MLA NA Haris as the party has decided to re-nominate him from Shanthinagara Assembly seat in Bengaluru, weeks after putting his ticket on hold over the assault allegations against his son Mohammad Nalapad. The state Congress had earlier decided against giving him the ticket after his son generated negative publicity with the alleged assault on a youth at a high-end pub in Bengaluru two months ago.   However, after scouting for a suitable candidate who could replace Haris, the ruling Congress seems to have fallen back on the two-time MLA to win the seat again.  "All surveys conducted by us predict Haris' win. He is still popular in the constituency. The BJP which is talking against corruption has fielded five candidates who went to jail during its last regime. In Haris' case, the MLA is innocent. He is facing no cases. The government has taken the strictest possible action against the son. He is in jail. We can't punish the father for his son's sins," a senior Congress leader said. After the Congress declared candidates for 218 seats at one go on Sunday night, Haris, whose name was not on the list, had allegedly threatened to quit the party and join the JD(S). Not ready to lose even a single seat in this 'do-or-die' battle for Karnataka, the Congress asked him not to quit and wait for a few more days. Haris' son Mohammad Nalapad was expelled from the Youth Congress two months ago after the assault which hit national headlines. The Karnataka High Court dismissed his bail application and the state government filed a caveat in the Supreme Court opposing his bail. Haris is a two-time MLA from Shanthinagara, a Muslim, Christian and Dalit-dominated Assembly seat in Bengaluru. Renowned historian Ramachandra Guha, a resident of the constituency, had opposed Haris' re-nomination. The Congress now hopes that re-nominating Haris doesn't lead to more trouble.

Anyone who knew the veteran actress would tell you that she was extremely fit and her sudden demise came as a shock to many. Now, the point to be noted is that she suffered a cardiac arrest and not a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a section of the heart. If not re-opened quickly, that part of the heart starts dying. Cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat. The heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs and the person loses consciousness.  Sridevi was rumoured to have gone under the knife several times. Botox treatments, lip-jobs, etc. she's done them all. While it is a personal choice, it seems these operations could've added to a higher stress level in her body, which culminated in a weak heart and eventually a cardiac arrest.

The BWSSB has imposed a penalty on over 3,000 consumers in the city. Corporators at BBMP recently protested over the BWSSB's method of augmenting the water bill with extra charges, even as board officials explained that they are only following the regulations brought in after a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in 2014. The regulations had been amended in February 2016.  BWSSB chief engineer (maintenance) H M Ravindra said the board had written to the BBMP several times to clarify the applicability of regulations making the OC mandatory. "We wanted a clear idea on how the regulation can be implemented and from whom a copy of the OC has to be collected for sanctioning water connections," Ravindra said.  "Although the regulation gives a fair idea on the slabs, we wanted the BBMP to clarify on the issuance of the OC, but till date, the Palike has not replied to our correspondence," he added. City residents, especially those living in residential complexes, do not possess an OC as it is either still with the builder or the builder did not receive it from the relevant agency. As a result, the residents as left with a hefty water bill. Raghavendra Prasad, who lives in an apartment in Kengeri, does not have an OC despite living there for over a decade. "We managed to get Cauvery water supply, but we still do not have the OC as it is still with the builder," he said. "Now, we are slapped with additional charges." BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said the issue is not about the penalty, crackdown on illegal constructions or issuing the OC. "We will have a joint meeting on December 11 to discuss various issues faced by both the BBMP and the BWSSB," he said.What the regulation saysBWSSB is charging 50% additional water charges from residential and 100% from commercial buildings having ground +2 floors for not producing occupancy certificateExemption is given to buildings having only ground +2 floorsThe board is providing temporary water connection to new buildings that are yet to receive the OC by collecting penalty charges Dailyhunt	|Friday, 08 Dec, 1.26 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/financial+chronicle-epaper-finance/chanda+kochhar+to+face+cbi+music+in+videocon+loan+case-newsid-84828950| Top News Chanda Kochhar to face CBI music in Videocon loan case |  City: New Delhi  Sources close to developments within CBI have told FC that there is every possibility of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar being questioned in the immediate short term. After questioning several ICICI Bank officials in the Videocon loan case where Rs 3,250 crore was sanctioned to Videocon Group in 2012, a large portion of which has now become NPA, the agency is all set to pin down the bank chief. In what is a classic case of cronyism, the investigative agency has registered a PE to find if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank issuing the loan to the Venugopal Dhoot company.  According to sources, after studying the confiscated documents, CBI believes approval for the loan came from the top and many rules were flouted. CBI, however, maintains that it's not an interrogation, but that Kochhar will only be examined to understand the loan procedure along with probing the benefits her husband (Deepak Kochhar) allegedly drew out of the transaction. The focus of the scrutiny would be the "money trail" among the key players and bankers, and a decision would soon be taken on what action could be taken by the I-T Department as well. Preliminary enquiry (PE) has named Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar, and unknown bank officials. Records show Dhoot provided crores of rupees to a firm promoted by Deepak Kochhar and two relatives six months after the Videocon Group got `3,250 crore as loan from ICICI Bank in 2012. The amount was part of the `40,000-crore loan that the Videocon Group secured from a consortium of 20 banks led by SBI. Dhoot gave `64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables, which he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. He transferred proprietorship of the firm to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for `9 lakh, six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank. Almost 86 per cent of the `3,250 crore loan (`2,810 crore) remains unpaid. The Videocon account was declared an NPA in 2017. Trustee, Indian Investors Protection Council, Arvind Gupta, the whistleblower in this case, said, "Dhoot transferred money from Videocon Group to Supreme Energy, in which he had 90 per cent shares. He promoted it and later transferred it to Deepak Kochhar. He then transferred his shareholdings to Pinnacle Energy. Pinnacle Energy was a trust formed by Kochhar family. Now they are saying they sold their shares of Nupower Renewables much before. NuPower was special purpose vehicle made to revert allegations in future. ICICI never gave it loan, but company was benefited." Dailyhunt	|Monday, 02 Apr, 3.11 am2 days agoa week ago3 weeks ago2 days ago3 weeks ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/east+coast+daily+eng-epaper-eeastco/asfina+bano+s+lawyer+is+threatened+by+colleagues-newsid-85616929| Home Asfina Bano's lawyer is threatened by colleagues | Asfina Bano the 8-year-old Kashmir girl who was brutally raped and murdered by 8 people in a temple. And now she awaits justice; only it is being delayed. In a shocking allegation, the lawyer of Asifa Bano has accused the president of the High Court Bar Association of harassment and threats for pleading the case of a minor girl. Deepika Singh Rajawat told a leading magazine that Bhupinder Singh Salathia tried to stop her from appearing in the court for Asifa.  Jammu Bar Association has demanded that the case be transferred to CBI, saying they don't trust the Crime Branch of J&K police which has investigated the case and presented a charge sheet against seven accused.  "I am not a Jammu Bar member," Rajawat said. "Knowing it well, Salathia tried to stop me and threatened me; he also used abusive language." She said Salathia warned her that he has the means to stop her. "I have filed a complaint against him to the chief justice of the J&K High Court and the chief justice of the Supreme Court," she said. She said she has demanded protection as she doesn't feel safe. "I am thankful to the chief justice of J&K High Court who has taken cognizance of my complaint and asked the security wing of J&K High Court to ensure I remain safe whenever I appear in the court." She said lawyers who are demanding a CBI probe into the case must understand that Crime Branch investigations were monitored by the High Court. "The Crime Branch investigated the case in a fair manner," Rajawat said. "The High Court has passed orders in the case after periodically monitoring the investigations by the Crime Branch." "We all know the evidence of the crime was destroyed so what is the CBI going to do now?" she asked. "If the Crime Branch is not investigating the case properly, they (lawyers) should have said it when the matter was sub judice," she said. Rajawat said they could have raised objections before the High Court or complained to the chief minister that the case is not being investigated properly.  "Calling a bandh and harassing people and the litigants is not the way," she said, adding that the lawyers can fight it out in the court and prove their point rather hitting the roads. On April 9, she wrote on Facebook, "Helpers in ladies bar room at trial courts have been directed not to offer me water by Jammu and Kashmir Bar Association." Watch ANI's video below.

But she [Rajawat] has not yet come to me or the SSP [Senior Superintendent of Police] about it. She needs to come to us if there is any such complaint." Since no official complaint had been made, he said, the police had not given protection. "The lawyers who are on strike right now need to understand one thing - that this case was monitored by High Court. Knowing it well, still, they demand that CBI should investigate it," said Rajawat. "We all know that at the initial stage, evidence was destroyed. What is the CBI going to do now?" She added that the lawyers are aware of remedies and should have tackled this at the initial stages before the High Court or the chief minister, instead of taking to the roads or harassing people and litigants. "They are lawyers, they know how the cases go ahead, " said Rajawat. "They can come to the court, they can plead their case well. If they are innocent, if the crime branch has not investigated the case properly or fairly, they can prove themselves innocent in the court. Instead of taking to the roads and pleading for CBI inquiry. They need to wait, they need to have patience. They need to go to the court and say 'Look, sir, we are innocent. Please, sir, test me'," she added. On Wednesday, the Jammu High Court Bar Association had called for a bandh in Jammu after the police registered an FIR against lawyers who tried to prevent them from filing a charge sheet in the Kathua rape and murder case. Before that, members of the Kathua Bar Association had staged a protest outside the district court in Jammu to prevent members of the state police from filing a charge sheet before the chief judicial magistrate. One of the lawyers said, "We have been opposing this since day one." They alleged that the investigation by state police was not fair, and demanded a probe by the CBI - the same demand was made by the Hindu Ekta Manch, a new group formed in Kathua in January 2018 to protest against the arrests of the accused in the case.

This is not something surprising or unexpected. It was just a matter of time before Nani was to hit the rock bottom. Film critics and diehard fans of Nani have been warning the hero after the movie 'Ninnu Kori'. Many believe that Nani is just trying to cash on the image he has built, and he has taken the fans lightly.   Trade experts expected that MCA would mark the beginning of the downfall for Nani. Produced and distributed by Dil Raju's, the movie managed to hold strong, given the family sentiment. At the same time, few sections credited Dil Raju's wide distribution for the film's success.    But this time around, Nani failed to escape from a disaster. 'Krishnarjuna Yuddham' is not only having a disastrous run in the Telugu states but also in the US. The Nani starrer failed to woo the NRI audience, failing to cross the $1 Million mark. Trade circles predict that Krishnarjuna Yuddham might even fall short of Nitin's 'Chal Mohan Ranga' collections.

Shrikrishna Kulkarni, the grandson of Ramdas Gandhi and the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, had written a letter to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi telling him to stop fooling people in the name of Mahatma Gandhi and to Gopalkrishna Gandhi to question his endorsement of Congress. In the letter, he wrote how most of the members of the Gandhi family had moved on from Mahatma Gandhi's assassination, but the current crop of Congress top brass are still harping on history.  "My humble suggestion, you folks who own Congress and your goof self should move on and quit milking the name Gandhi and this issue for your selfish benefits," he said. "To keep harping that the RSS killed Gandhi is akin to saying the Tamils killed your father, which would be a petty falsehood isn't it? A couple of guys don't make for a community." In the letter, he also asked Rahul Gandhi to stop fooling people.       In another letter addressed to his uncle Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Kulkarni said that he was disappointed to see him filing for Vice-Presidential candidature flanked this family of dynastic politics. He stated that this family does not deserve to be linked with anything to do with Mahatma Gandhi. He also said that Gandhiji committed a mistake by appointing Jawaharlal Nehru the Prime Minister over Sardar Vallabhai Patel. He said that the progeny of Nehru had made a mockery of all that Gandhiji stood for and he cannot bear to see it happen anymore.          Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 30 Jul, 4.03 am

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday paid floral tributes at the bust of the saint at Albert Embankment Gardens in London, where he is today as part of a four-day trip to Sweden and England.   After unveiling a statue of the saint, Prime Minister Narendra Modi uploaded this video on Twitter.   On his Jayanti, I bow to Bhagwan Basaveshwara. He has a special place in our history and culture. His emphasis on social harmony, brotherhood, unity and compassion always inspires us. Bhagwan Basaveshwara brought our society together and gave importance to knowledge. pic.twitter.com/akJPVyuH5D— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 18, 2018      Amit Shah, who is in Karnataka for another round of campaign ahead of the polls, started the day with a visit to a Basaveshwara statue. The BJP national president visited several Lingayat mutts and met leaders of the sect in Karnataka.     The Congress was not too far behind. The party also made similar plans for Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Congress President Rahul Gandhi offered his tribute as well.  My tributes to Basavanna on the auspicious occasion of Basava Jayanti. ಬಸವ ಜಯಂತಿಯ ಶುಭ ದಿನದಂದು ಮಹಾಕಾಯಕ ಯೋಗಿ ಬಸವಣ್ಣನವರಿಗೆ ನನ್ನ ಭಕ್ತಿ , ಗೌರವ ಪೂರ್ಣ ನಮನಗಳು— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) April 18, 2018   There was much drama too between the BJP and the Congress on this sudden spurt of veneration of the saint. "Siddaramaiah should not be allowed to garland any statue of Basaveshwara throughout the state," said Shobha Karandlaje, the BJP lawmaker from Udupi-Chikmagalur constituency. She went on to add, "Mr Siddaramaiah split the Lingayat community only with an intention to gain votes and create a vote bank for his party... I request all the Lingayats and Veerashaivas to bar Siddaramaiah from garlanding Basaveshwara's statue." Though Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaih has maintained silence on her BJP's outburst, his home minister Ramalinga Reddy lost his cool. "Who is she? Who is she to tell us? Basaveshwara is not the property of Shobha Karandlaje," Reddy said. The BJP, which traditionally enjoyed support among the state's substantial Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, has been blindsided by the Congress move to provide Lingayats with religious minority status, which helps a community get government grants and other advantages in education. The Congress move has even found support among the key religious figures in the community. One of them even communicated this to BJP chief Amit Shah during his visit to the state and later, made the letter public. The BJP, on its part have gone all out to stem the uprising. Over the last month, the BJP leaders belonging to the Lingayat community, including its chief ministerial candidate BS Yedyurappa, have spoken at length, alleging the Congress move is politically motivated.

The Internet Broke the Mahabharata | Too caught up to read the story? Listen to it instead.Thank you Biplab Kumar Deb. India's biggest technological breakthrough can finally be rightfully reclaimed. We invented the internet - the reason all of you can watch yoga videos on Youtube (the yoga reference put in for obvious reasons - if you must rub in civilisational greatness, you may as well go the whole hog).Anyway, coming back to the Tripura CM - he said that internet and satellite communication was the reason Sanjaya could give such a vivid account of the battle of Kurukshetra to King Dhritarashtra. There is no reason to disbelieve him - and there is no evidence to suggest the contrary. In fact, I do believe the honourable minister in all humility has grossly understated the facts. The internet, not Lord Krishna, played a starring role in moving things along in the Mahabharata. Here are a few things that he missed out on, which I will be glad to fill you in on.Family Whatsapp Group Troubles Began in 8th Century BCThe root of all conflict in the Mahabharata can be traced back to a sunny afternoon in the 8th century BC when young Yudhishthira decided to create a family WhatsApp group. Believing that a WhatsApp group can only accommodate a maximum of 100 people, the young lad left out a few of his cousins. Not too many - just 100 of them. It was hardly his fault that there were 100 Kauravas to begin with.Fortunately, the resident geek Vidura intervened and gently pointed out that a WhatsApp group can now go up to 256. Being unnaturally scrupulous, Yudhishthira added all of his cousins, but naturally remained group administrator. This inflamed Duryodhana but try as he might, he couldn't wrest control of the group. Adding further fuel to the fire were the incessant core training videos that Bhima uploaded on the group - given Duryodhana's suspect core, it was clear who was being targeted. Duryodhana exited the group, swearing one day to take it over. He could have easily set up his own group, but he was petty that way.'Complicated' FB Relationship Statuses & 'Shakuni Analytica'Then the contentious issue of WiFi. Bhishma, the passive aggressive laissez faire patriarch, decreed that the router to happiness could only be one. With 100 Kauravas and 5 Pandavas, you can imagine who ended up hogging the internet. This particularly displeased the pretty boys Nakul and Sahadev who had built quite a following on Instagram by posting pouting selfies.They also occasionally put up guess-who posts which had all of Hastinapur's girls blushing and sighing. But now their upload time took forever and their following had plateaued. In all of this, one thing was clear - Hastinapur quite clearly didn't have the bandwidth to deal with two sets of rulers.And then Draupadi. It can finally be told what the final catalyst in the feud was. Draupadi in her relationship status on Facebook wrote in all truthfulness, 'It is complicated'. Thirty seconds later, Duryodhana sent her a knowing 'wink emoticon' on Messenger. A furious Draupadi blocked him - and the rest, as they say, is a BR Chopra soap.Finally, however, the entire Pandava clan exited Facebook after they realised their data is being sold to 'Shakuni Analytica' - a shady market research firm on the payroll of Duryodhana to rig the popular mood in Hastinapur.Final Nail in Mahabharata's Coffin? Fake NewsHowever, their exit from Facebook came a little too late, after Bhima made the tragic error of checking in to Facebook in the 13th year of their exile in Virata. This led to their discovery, and Duryodhana reneging on his promise to restore the kingdom to them. In retrospect, marking themselves 'safe' after Lakshagraha burnt down wasn't the smartest move either. The perils of internet addiction - we know it too well, having invented it.And finally, the last blow that the internet struck the Mahabharata: the fake news algorithms played fast and loose with the happenings on the battleground in Kurukshetra. This was called the 'Ashwatthama effect', and played a crucial part in swinging things the Pandava way. Not to mention, the many motivational forwards Lord Krishna sent Arjuna on doing his duty - motivational memes, GIFs and even a TEDx video on 'Doing your Dharma'.The above is only a very short gist of the many ways the Mahabharata was affected by the internet. It is indeed shameful that many centuries later, the Western world should take credit for what is one of our most stupendous discoveries. More power to Biplab Kumar Deb. Let false notions of Western innovation and discovery crumble like Lenin statues in Tripura.The Caravan this week published a series of stories on the death of CBI special judge BH Loya in December 2014. Journalist Niranjan Takle has spoken extensively to the family of Judge Loya, who, before he died, was presiding over the high-profile Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter killing case - in which a prime accused was BJP President Amit Shah. Shah was discharged by the judge who succeeded Judge Loya.The revelations made by Judge Loya's sisters, father and others form the basis of the stories. These, along with Takle's own investigation, who spoke to officials in Nagpur who dealt with Loya's body after he was found dead, raise several grave questions.1. Why was Judge JT Utpat, Judge Loya's predecessor in hearing the case, transferred from hearing the case despite a 2012 Supreme Court order specifying that the same judge should hear the matter from start to finish?2. Were Bombay High Court Chief Justice Mohit Shah or the principal accused Amit Shah aware of any alleged inducements offered to Judge Loya to ensure a favourable judgment in the case?3. Does Justice Mohit Shah deny the allegation by Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani, that he himself made an offer of Rs 100 crore in return for a favourable judgment?[Takle had received no response from Justice Shah at the time of publication of the article mentioning this allegation]4. Who made the arrangements for Judge Loya's transportation to Dande Hospital on the night of his death, and why was this not in a vehicle from the government guest house or an ambulance?5. Do Dande Hospital and/or Meditrina Hospital have records indicating what medication was provided to Judge Loya while in their care, and who was with him at the time?6. What was the time of Judge Loya's death according to the records of Meditrina Hospital and when do call records show this was intimated to Judge Loya's family? Did the death occur at 6:15 am or before 5 am on 1 December 2014, or did it in fact occur before midnight?[Judge Loya's family says they received calls informing them of his death from 5 am in the morning onwards, but the post-mortem report specifies the time of death as 6:15 am, and other sources informed Takle that Judge Loya passed away before midnight]The Quint has not conducted an independent corroboration of the claims made in the articles, and therefore does not affirm the truth of such claims. These include alleged discrepancies between the post-mortem report and the condition of Judge Loya's body and clothes, as well as allegations that the then Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court offered monetary inducements to Judge Loya to give a favourable judgment.Nonetheless, the gravity of these claims (several of which are made on video here), which strike at the very heart of the judicial system if true, necessitates that they be investigated properly at the very least.7. In what circumstances can a person die of "coronary artery insufficiency"? Is it possible for a person in good physical health without any cardiac history or other markers of this condition, experience "coronary artery insufficiency" and lose their life?[Judge Loya's sister, a doctor, claims that Judge Loya had no medical history consistent with the condition, and that this raised doubts as to whether this could be the cause of death]8. Why was a post-mortem report ordered into Judge Loya's death when no panchnama or FIR was filed terming it a suspicious death, and why was Judge Loya's family not informed about the performance of a post-mortem? Alternatively, were any reasons for performance of post-mortem report recorded, where were these recorded and who recorded them?9. Who signed the post-mortem report pages as "maiyatacha chulatbhau" (ie paternal cousin brother of the deceased) when no relation of Judge Loya was present in Nagpur? Does the countersignatory, the senior police inspector of Sadar police station, recollect who this was?10. What was Ishwar Baheti's relationship with the deceased and on what basis was he coordinating the funeral arrangements for Judge Loya, including contacting the family? Why was Judge Loya's phone returned to the family by Mr Baheti rather than the police? Alternatively, did the police ask Mr Baheti to return the phone to Judge Loya's family?11. Does Judge Loya's family still have the allegedly bloodstained shirt worn by Judge Loya at the time of death which the post-mortem report claims was dry?12. Is it true that the CBI was only given 15 minutes to argue against the discharge of Amit Shah in subsequent hearings of the case before Judge Loya's successor in hearing the case, Judge Gosavi, as against three days for the defence lawyers?13. Who made the decision to announce MS Dhoni's retirement from test cricket on 30 December 2014? Was this decided by the player or the BCCI and did any external source suggest the specific date?[Judge Loya's sister alleges that Judge Loya was informed that if he would deliver the judgment in the case before 30 December 2014, it would not be under focus because another news story would dominate the headlines and distract focus from the judgment](Breathe In, Breathe Out: Are you finding it tough to breathe polluted air?

At the same time, neurons in degenerating brains are known to accumulate glycogen.  A team of Indian scientists found glycogen in neurons actually has a protective role in patients with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Huntington's. For long, scientists have been trying to find specific role of glycogen in neurons, especially in brain diseases like Huntington's, Lafora, Alzheimer's etc. Some believe it to be neurotoxic.  The new study led by Subramaniam Ganesh of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) suggests that glycogen has a protective role in neurons of patients suffering with neurodegenerative disorders. Glycogen synthetic machinery in healthy neurons usually remains in an inactive state. In this machinery, an enzyme called glycogen synthase catalyses the formation of glycogen. Using cellular and animal models of Huntington's disease, the researchers have shown that high level of cytotoxic mutant Huntington protein triggers more glycogen synthesis in neurons by activating glycogen synthase. They observed that increased level of glycogen synthase protects neurons from the cytotoxicity of the mutant Huntingtin protein. "Our findings establish that glycogen synthase is required for neurons to survive during stress. We also show that glycogen thus synthesized prevents aggregation of abnormal proteins, and helps in their clearance. These findings might open up new avenues of therapeutic interventions," Ganesh said. The activation of glycogen synthase is harmful to healthy and happy neurons, and this may explain why glycogen granules are not seen in normal neurons. This means glycogen accumulation in degenerating brain could possibly represent a failed attempt of neurons to survive during the stress.  "Our work establishes neuroprotective role of glycogen synthase in Huntington's disease models and thus discovers a previously unknown function of glycogen synthase in neuronal physiology", he added. "It is an important finding on protective role of glycogen synthase in neurodegenerative diseases which may have translational relevance," said Sathees C. Raghavan from Indian Institute of Science. He is not connected with this study.  "These findings may open exciting possibilities for developing new therapeutic approaches for the neurodegenerative diseases which are becoming serious health issues in human populations in recent times," said SC Lakhotia from Banaras Hindu University. He too is not a part of this study. The study was published in journal Cell Death and Disease. The research team included Anupama Rai, Pankaj K Singh, Virender Singh, Rohit Mishra, Ashwani K Thakur, and Subramaniam Ganesh (IIT-Kanpur); Vipendra Kumar, Nihar R Jana (National Brain Research Centre, Manesar); Anita Mahadevan, Susarla K Shankar, (NIMHANS, Bengaluru).

National Herald will be publishing a counterpoint to this opinion alongside this To protect innocent citizens against false criminal cases is a noble principle. It is however not a new principle that India has discovered. On the other hand, the element of 'innocence' is a subjective perception in a society where the caste system manifested through one's social status as 'pure' or 'impure, and 'high' or 'low' caste, leads to the widely accepted view that multiple forms of untouchability are a creation of God.  Indian law has criminalised discriminatory behaviour under the influence of caste in the public sphere, but has refrained from upholding caste as anti-national, immoral and irreligious, even when it has failed miserably to abolish untouchability and practices such as manual scavenging after seven decades of its independence. The controversial guidelines issued by the judges of the Supreme Court in relation to the Prevention of Atrocities Act (PAA) however cannot be attributed to similar caste bias. That would amount to contempt of court. But it is curious how there is ample place in our democratic life to check caste prejudices of civil servants, political leaders and religious leaders, but not of the judiciary. In 1994, I came across a case in Dhandhuka town of Gujarat, where the police brutally beat up a Dalit youth for purchasing a stolen bicycle for Rs 200. He was confined to a police lockup for more than 36 hours. The poor man was unable to even stand up on his feet and therefore the police produced his younger brother before the magistrate as the person they had arrested. The arrested man was later rushed by family members to the government hospital, where the doctor registered the case history and informed the police. The mention of the police frightened the man and he refused to be treated. The same night the police made out a story that he had hanged himself in his own house. The man who could not even stand had raised himself so that he could hang. The case was argued in the Gujarat High Court. In my presence, when the prosecutor defended the police action, deeply perturbed by the photographs of the injuries on the deceased, the judge asked the prosecutor, 'Had there been a policeman in the place of the victim, what would you say?' The prosecutor replied without hesitation, 'My Lord, the law differs from person to person'. Next time I heard of the prosecutor, he had just been appointed a judge at the Bombay High Court. The doctor, who had recorded the injuries on the body of the victim, also turned hostile and held that his writing was a 'slip of the pen'. He was a Dalit. The police were acquitted. The law was abused, not by the Dalits but by the state prosecutor, the police and the doctor. The law in fact protected all of them but failed to protect the victim. I was often invited to deliver lectures at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal. At one such lecture on Prevention of Atrocities Act, a senior judge intervened and said, "If we walk on the path of the Vedas and Puranas, the country does not require a law." A sessions judge, duly promoted to the post, told me that this senior judge had advised him: 'Do not convict too many people under PAA and do not dispose of the cases speedily'. In atrocity related cases, judges often suggest an amicable settlement before the trial begins. It is not uncommon to overhear the trial court judges themselves using derogatory caste words for Dalits. The need for an anti-untouchability law was discussed, and it is recorded as part of the Poona Pact (1932), which promised that if such a law could not be enacted immediately it would be the first law in Independent India. However, the law did not come until 1955 when India enacted the Untouchability Offences Act. With the continuing and increasing crimes against Dalits, India enacted Civil Rights Protection Act, 1976, which popularly came to be known Prevention of Atrocities Act. To give more teeth to the Act, all political parties contributed to the newly amended anti-atrocities Act, 2016. The law was not amended overnight. The process took more than four years and the draft was screened by the Standing Committee of Parliament and even the Law Commission. I am sure the judges of the Supreme Court who passed the recent guidelines were aware about these developments. I have my own reservations to certain aspects caste-based reservations. I have worked for 38 years addressing the cause of untouchability and caste discrimination. I redefined Dalits as 'all those who believe and practice equality'. I am aware and have written extensively that Dalits too have caste hierarchy within and they too practice untouchability. Navsarjan was the first organization perhaps to do a comprehensive study on prevalence of untouchability as practices between Dalits and others and within the Dalits on the basis of sub-caste. I have had the personal experiences of being ex-communicated by other sections of Dalits for having eaten in the home of a Valmiki, most of whom are engaged in manual scavenging. Often, I have been accused of being a non-Dalit. But I have experienced untouchability as a child working in farms and have closely seen caste realities living in villages for many years. And yet, I firmly believe that one cannot throw away baby with the dirty bath water. Gandhi had told his inmates after bitter happenings of the Poona Pact to the effect that even if Dalits were to smash the heads of caste Hindus they should not complain for the volume of injustice for centuries that have been heaped on them. The root cause of the problem is prevalence and pervasiveness of caste system and the arms of law are too weak to annihilate it. If there is a demand to introduce caste based reservations in the judiciary at all levels, it would be logical and rational. Please read the counterpoint to this opinion here.

Now, in an interview with India Today, Sri Reddy has accused a producer's son of sexually exploiting her. Without revealing the name of the person, Sri has claimed that he used to force her to have sex with him.  "He used to take me to the studio and he used to f**k me. He is the son of a top producer who is ruling the Tollywood. He used to force sex on me. He would ask me to come to the studio and I said I will go only to talk, not for any sexual act. But after going there, he used to force (me to have) sex," the report quoted the actress as saying. Though Sri Reddy has not named the person, she has agreed to reveal the identity along with a few photos. She also gave a shocking statement that the people from the film industry use studios like "brothels".  Sri Reddy's allegations have left the Telugu cinegoers wondering about the identity of person who 'sexploited' her. "Who is unnamed producer's son who sexploited budding actress? #SriReddy," a fan wrote on Twitter. The actress had recently stripped and went topless before the public and media in front of the office of Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce in Hyderabad to show protest against casting couch.  Sri Reddy says that North Indian actresses get offers to work in movies as they are "flexible" in terms of giving "sexual favors". In an interview to a TV channel, the actress said, "For the last 10-15 years, we are only watching North Indian girls as the heroine. Why not Telugu girls? A lot of people are saying that these North Indian girls who are coming from the other states, they will give them sexual favours and all. That's the reason Tollywood filmmakers are showing interest toward these North or other state women. That is the only reason they are getting roles; because they are flexible to everything, and Telugu women are not." The actress claims that many filmmakers have asked her to send nude photos and videos. Despite fulfilling their requests, Sri Reddy was not given any role in their movies.

Mahendra Singh  Dhoni is arguably one of the greatest  finishers the game has ever witnessed. However, the former India skipper's image has taken a beating in recent times. Unlike his glorious past, the veteran batsman Dhoni now usually takes his time to settle down before going for the big shots. Not surprisingly, he faces severe criticism for his batting every now and then. However, the World Cup-winning captain, on Sunday (April 15), showed that he has still got it. He played a  whirlwind knock of 79 off just 44 balls  against Kings XI Punjab and nearly took his team to a miraculous win.  Chasing a daunting 198, Super Kings had their back against the wall. With 67 runs needed off last four overs, Kings XI were looking like the firm favourites. However, Dhoni was yet to throw in the towel. From a position where only one result seemed possible, Dhoni took the opposition bowlers to the cleaners to revive the chase, Battling a stiff back, he turned back the clock with some glorious shots.  Dhoni in full form against Punjab (Credits: BCCI) He was on 33 off 28 balls, with Super Kings requiring 65 off 21 balls. And then began the carnage. From that position, he hit three fours and three sixes. The 36-year-old Dhoni struck Kings XI's death-overs specialist Andrew Tye for 19 runs off the penultimate over. The equation was finally down to 17 from the last over. However, Super Kings could only manage 12 and lost the game by four runs. But despite the loss, Dhoni is receiving widespread praise. And the latest person to lavish praise on him is none other than Kings XI's mentor and his former teammate Virender Sehwag. The batting star Sehwag said that Dhoni has impressed him a lot and lauded him for braving back pain - to fight for his team.  "MS Dhoni is one of the players who have impressed me a lot so far in this season of the IPL. Considering his age and the fact that he had back pain, Dhoni decided to keep on batting against Kings XI Punjab. I think if there would have been any other player in place of Dhoni, he would have left the field and went back to the dressing room. But being the captain, Dhoni took the responsibility and stood there till the end," Sehwag told India TV.  He further said that he was taken aback by Dhoni's attitude.  Even a back pain did not deter Dhoni (Credits: BCCI)  "I was surprised not with his performance but with his attitude. Had it been any other player in place of Dhoni, he would have surely left the field. Dhoni was struggling to run between the wickets but he still batted till the end. The way he was hitting those sixes, it never looked as if he had a bad back. He never showed to the opposition that he was struggling. So, you have to give credit to Dhoni because if he wasn't there, CSK would have lost the match by 50 runs," Sehwag said.

In this budget you can't really expect top class performance, but you can still get a usable day-to-day laptop, which are the best laptops under 30000? Well, we are here to help and this is our list of the best laptops under 30K. These laptops offer a good combination of design, build quality, performance and display. While you can get better laptops for more, these is the current list of the top laptops under 30000.   Asus X541UA  According to to us the best laptop under 30000 is the Asus Vivobook X541UA. The laptop is powerful and can handle most day-to-day tasks, thanks to the 7th gen Intel Core i3 processor. There is 4GB of RAM and 1TB HDD storage on the laptop, but you don't get a OS pre-installed.   Lenovo Ideapad 110  What can get you on a laptop under 30000? Well, for starters 4GB of RAM and 1TB HDD. This Lenovo Ideapad 110 also comes with Windows 10 pre-installed out of the box. The 15.6-inch HD display is usable and the performance from the Intel's 6the gen Core i3 processor is better than most laptops in this price category.   Dell Inspiron 3565  If you are more bang for your buck, maybe the dell Inspiron 3565 will satisfy your needs. The laptop comes with 6GB of RAM which is coupled with a AMD dual Core A9 chip.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/stressbuster-epaper-strbusen/do+you+know+live+in+relationship+is+a+type+of+marriage+in+hinduism-newsid-72376758| Did You Know  Do You Know Live-In Relationship Is A Type Of Marriage In Hinduism? |    Hindu Marriage joins two individuals for life, so that they can pursue dharma (duty), artha (possessions), kama (physical desires), and moksha (ultimate spiritual release) together. It is a union of two individuals as husband and wife, and is recognized by law.   Every Indian Couple Must Live-In Before Getting Married, These Reasons Will Tell You Why   It also joins two families together. Favorable colours are normally red and gold for this occasion. Here are the types of marriages that do occur in Hinduism.  Brahma Marriage The Brahma marriage is the marriage of one's daughter, after decking her with costly garments and with presents of jewels, to a man of good conduct learned in the Vedas, and invited by oneself.A Brahma marriage is where a boy is able to get married once he has completed his student hood, or Brahmacharya. Brahma marriage has the most supreme position of the eight types of Hindu matrimony. When the parents of the boy seek for a female, they would consider her family background, but the girl's father would make sure that the boy that wishes to wed his daughter had the knowledge of Vedas. It is these things that make the basis for Brahma marriage, not a system of dowry.    Daiva Marriage The type of marriage that is considered inferior because it is degrading to womanhood is Daiva marriage. This is where the woman's family will wait for a specific time to get her wed. If she doesn't get a suitable groom, then she would be married off to places where family choose by matchmaking through priest who duly officiates at a religious ceremony, during the course of its performance.    Arsha Marriage An Arsha marriage is where the girl is married to the sages. The bride will be given in exchange for two cows. Because it is cows that are given in exchange of the bride, it shows that the groom does not have any special qualities. A noble marriage has no business transactions, or monetary, so therefore an Arsha marriage is not considered as a noble matrimony and don't have religious sanction.    Prajapatya Marriage Prajapatya is when a girl's father gives her in marriage to the bridegroom, treating him with respect, and addresses them: 'May both of you perform together your duties'. Unlike in Brahma marriage, Prajapatya matrimony is where the bride's father goes in search of a groom, although this isn't considered as good as the grooms parents searching for the perfect bride. Also, unlike Arsha marriage, monetary transactions are not a part of the Prajapatya marriage.    Gandharva Marriage The voluntary union of a maiden and her lover on own is called Gandharva marriage. When it comes to 'love' marriage, it is Gandharva marriage that is the most similar. This is where a groom and his bride will wed without their parents knowledge. However, it is not correctly considered as a type of marriage because it does not have the consent of the parents. The Gandharva type of marriage is the modern day live-in Relation.    Asura Marriage Asura marriage is when the bridegroom receives a maiden, after having given of his own free will as much wealth as he can afford, to the bride and her kinsmen. It is Asura marriage that sets itself apart from the other types of marriage. This is a matrimony where the groom is not in the slightest bit compatible with the bride, what is compatible is that the bride's father likes money and the groom is happy to surrender his own wealth. In modern times this type of marriage isn't entirely acceptable because it is much like buying a product off the shelf.It doesn't have religious sanction either.    Rakshasha Marriage Rakshasa marriage is the marriage of a maiden involving her forcible abduction from her home after her kinsmen have been slain or wounded. The groom will forge battles with the bride's family, overcome them and carry the bride away to convince her to marry him. Because of the forcible methods used in this marriage type, it is not considered right. A girl should not be wooed this way to tie the wedding knot with a groom.    Paishachya Marriage When a man by stealth seduces a girl who is sleeping, intoxicated, or mentally challenged, it is called Paishacha marriage. This is condemned in the Manusmriti as a base and sinful act.     Same Sex Marriage  There are both conservative and liberal views about homosexuality and same-sex marriages in Hinduism with Hindu priests having performed marriage of same sex couples. The KamaSutra acknowledges third-gender marriages wherein same-sex couples with "great attachment and complete faith in one another" get married together. In 2004, Hinduism Today asked Hindu swamis (teachers) their opinion of same-sex marriage. The swamis expressed a range of opinions, positive and negative.    Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 27 Aug, 6.45 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/trak+in-epaper-trakin/india+tops+broadband+speed+improvement+in+ookla+s+speedtest+global+index+2017-newsid-78439725| Internet India Tops Broadband Speed Improvement In Ookla's Speedtest Global Index 2017! | Right now India is in the midst of a digital revolution. With some of the lowest 4G data prices available anywhere in the world, more and more Indians are logging online to work, consume media and even shop. But this was not always the case. Internet has had a slow start in India with marginal increase in speed over the years. But that changed when Airtel introduced 4G in India. Compared to the past the data speed improved significantly. But the real revolution began when Jio entered the market. Where previously the data was very expensive and out of reach of most people, Jio came along and started giving away data for free.  This triggered a pricing war with companies trying to our-price each other out of the market. Jio's network is also significant because it is the first 4G-VoLTE network in India and it is the only VoLTE-only network in India. It means that Jio works only on 4G network! Ookla has reported that India has topped the list of countries which have improved their average download speed on fixed-line broadband and grabbed the second spot in improvement in mobile internet download speed. But, do these numbers tell the whole story? Let's find out. Yes, India has improved the most in broadband download speeds in 2017, beating the likes of China, Japan and USA with a 76.9% improvement. In mobile download speeds though, India came in second behind Pakistan, but ahead of Brazil, Japan and USA, with a 42.4% improvement. But these numbers do not tell the whole story. Take a look at the two tables below. Can you see what is happening? India has achieved these ranks in 'World's Most Populous Countries' category. In the overall rankings in terms of improvement in speeds, it was Laos who took the first spot with 249.5% improvement in broadband download speeds. A tiny, little-known island named Reunion took the top spot in mobile download speeds with 141.5% improvement. Globally, internet speed has increased 30% in 2017. Now let us look at some raw speed numbers.  Norway leads by a significant margin in mobile download with speed of 62.66 Mbps, while Singapore leads the way in broadband download with speed of 153.85 Mbps. To put things in a global perspective, India ranks at no. 109 in mobile downloads with a speed of 8.80 Mbps and comes in at no. 76 in broadband download with speed of 18.82 Mbps. These numbers are the stark reality. India still has a long way to go before it can catch up with the leaders. But it is not all bleak. Co-Founder and General Manager at Ookla, Doug Suttles said, "Mobile and broadband internet speeds in India have certainly evolved in last couple of years. India still has a long way to go to catch up with countries that have top speeds around the world, however, we at Ookla are highly optimistic about the capacity for growth that is available in the Indian market," The data in Ookla's Speedtest Global Index 2017 has been derived from tests taken by real people who use Ookla's Speedtest app every month. It is interesting to know that Ookla has 439 Speedtest servers in India out of the 7,021 servers globally. Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 20 Dec, 8.14 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/8+things+that+make+the+bold+and+fearless+stand+out-newsid-86005076| Lifestyle 8 Things that Make the Bold and Fearless Stand Out |  Fearlessness begins from within.  Back in the day, a wise man said, "Once you become fearless, life becomes limitless."  But what does 'fearless' actually mean? You may believe that 'fearless' means having no fear, whatsoever, but it isn't actually that.  Being fearless means having the courage to overcome what frightens us, and being bold enough to get past it. It's true that bold and fearless people succeed because they think, speak and act differently than those who limit themselves to excuses. These people not only carry power and impact in their words but also take control of their priorities and manage fears effectively.  Fear really brings out the best in us once we learn how to manage it. And just as we become bold and courageous to do something, without having a sense of thought about failing or the consequences, we experience triumph. If being bold and courageous is something of your interest, here's what makes these individuals stand out: Learning from the past  Brave people learn from their experiences and improve. They do not dwell or get ashamed of their failure, rather they overcome it and stop failing. Failing is the greatest thing that helps one conquer their fears. Those who haven't failed haven't tasted success. Stay passionate You've gathered the courage yet passion is what drives that force to fight the odds. Datsun celebrates just the kind of virtues as part of their #MorePower2You campaign. It talks about the bold expressions and passion by focussing on the bold and unconventional paths taken by Datsun Redi-GO owners to achieve their dreams. Check out this two-minute film about a Datsun owner showcasing the obstacles he overcame to achieve his dreams and how his Datsun Redi-GO was an integral part of his journey. Challenge themselves  While fear may seem like something that consumes us, courageous people bring the best of their fear by challenging themselves to improve each time. Without being afraid, these individuals go against the flow and push their limits and overcome their own challenges. Take action  If you're afraid of heights, you'll forever be afraid unless you try bungee-jumping or something similar that overtakes the thought of fear. It's important to take necessary action to conquer what we fear, and that's what daring people do. Trust themselves  The most important thing audacious people do is that they believe in themselves. They keep the promises they make and don't back down. Self-believing is an important quality when it's about being a bold person. Learn new skills  If you're afraid of something, learn it. Bold people enjoy challenges and take them as they come. If you're afraid of public speaking, practise. Only doing things you're afraid of is gonna make you better. Take control and shrink your fear  Daring people know that fear is only gonna bring the best out of them. Remember, fear is only in your head and you have the power to control it. Look fear in the eye, and see it get smaller and smaller. You'll soon pull yourself out of it. Seek help  Fearless people never fear rejection. If you think you need help, ask for it. Ask a mentor or a teacher. Ask for direction. Fearful people fear rejection, while fearless people are good at asking for and receiving help. Now you know what makes these individuals stand out, it's time to start implementing the same in your life and become bold and fearless. Just like Datsun Redi-GO users.
