https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/indo+nepal+dam+faces+uncertain+future-newsid-80865887| Opinion Indo-Nepal dam faces uncertain future | A 5,600 MW power project along the Mahakali river, which flows between Nepal and Uttarakhand is yet another sub-Himalayan hydropower project causing a great deal of concern, not only among over 30,000 affected families but also environmentalists, social activists and others. The current agitation against this huge hydropower dam is a reminder of the previous such agitations against dams that have already been built in Uttarakhand in the central Himalayas, such as the 2,400 MW Tehri dam, which continues to face stiff problems even years after its commissioning. The uprooted local people complain about not having been adequately compensated even to this day.  The Pancheshwar dam, which is to be built on the Mahakali will be one of the tallest dams in the world. Flowing from Nepal through Uttarakhand, the river enters Uttar Pradesh, flowing south-east across the plains to join the Ghaghra river, a tributary of the Ganga. It descends from 11,800 feet at Kalapani to 660 feet as it enters the Terai plains, offering an unutilised hydropower potential. In fact, with a proposed height of 315 metres, Pancheshwar will be the second largest dam in the world. The project is roughly estimated to cost Rs 35,000 crore, the construction is scheduled to begin in September 2018 and the dam is to be ready by September 2026. Social activists like Medha Patkar and environmentalists like Sundar Lal Bhuguna have already expressed their opposition to the dam. While activists are worried over the uprooting and rehabilitation of villagers from the dam site, environmentalists have expressed concern over its serious upstream and downstream environmental impacts. Some geologists say that the dam site is a seismically active fault. Uttarakhand is in Category 4 and 5 on the seismic map of India and has experienced several major and minor quakes at regular intervals over the last century. Therefore, doubts over the safety of the proposed dam are natural. Landslides are also one of the major devastating natural hazards causing major damage to life and property sometimes. In 1998, a landslide near Okhimath in Rudraprayag district in the upper catchment area of the Ganga claimed 101 lives and rendered hundreds homeless. Thus, on the basis of whatever is being said on the social, environmental and safety dimensions, even some leaders of political parties, like the Communist Party of Nepal and the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) have also opposed the idea of this big hydropower project. Some UKD leaders point out to how people uprooted by Tehri dam continue to suffer years after it was built. The Pancheshwar Dam reservoir is expected to submerge some 123 villages in the three districts of Uttarakhand, namely Pithoragarh, Almora and Champawat, and cover some 11,600 hectares of land, including 9,100 hectares of dense forests. Therefore, the opposition to the dam is gradually intensifying. Alerted by this anti-dam movement, the government has conducted public hearings on the issue. However, these open house hearings of complaints and suggestions have not helped in assuaging the feelings of the affected people. Hollow assurances The repeated assurances by the government on their proper rehabilitation and adequate compensation, have not helped pacify the affected locals and they continue to stick to their guns. Fearing further intensification of the agitation against the dam, the Uttarakhand government is understood to have now formulated a draft policy for the rehabilitation of affected families. According to some reports, a proposal has been made to pay the displaced people six times more than the existing circle rate in the affected areas. It may be mentioned here that parleys between India and Nepal on the possibility of building this dam have been going on since 1956 when for the first time the then Central Water Commission had evinced interest in such a project, to be beneficial to both countries. But the actual ground work towards achieving this goal did not begin until the early 90s, which eventually culminated in a treaty between the two countries in 1996 called the Mahakali Treaty. Subsequently, a plan to prepare a detailed project report was put in place, but problems over a different set of issues between the two countries remained unresolved and affected progress on the dam. The MoU between the two countries was signed after a long gap in 2014 and the Pancheshwar Development Authority was created. In the meantime, the prime ministers of both countries also took interest in early completion of this mega project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nepal's outgoing Prime Minster Sher Bahadur Deuba are understood to have discussed the project keenly during their respective visits. This dam, to be located about 2.5 km downstream of the confluence of Mahakali and Sarju rivers near the famous Pancheshwar temple in Champawat district of Uttarakhand, is expected to irrigate 2,59,000 hectares of land in India and 1,70,000 hectares in Nepal. Interestingly, this river is also proposed as a source for one of the Himalayan components of the Indian river interlinking project.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Then we must tell you all that this 32-year-old Bharat Kalicharan was basically serial killer, rapist and extortionist.  Akku Yadav was a man of criminal nature and there were many accusations of tampering with women and sexual assault on him. Bharat Kalicharan, alias Akku Yadav (1972-August 13, 2004), was a 32-year-old rapist and murderer in India who, on August 13, 2004, was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar.    Yadav was stabbed over seventy times, and chili powder and stones were thrown in his face. One of his alleged victims also hacked off his penis. This lynching occurred in Nagpur district court, on the marble floor of the courtroom.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/webdunia+english-epaper-webeng/un+wants+consensual+sex+decriminalised+in+pakistan-newsid-85343197| Home UN wants consensual sex decriminalised in Pakistan | Islamabad: In a surprise move, Pakistan has officially 'noted' a recommendation made during the third Universal Periodic Review (UPR) which suggest repealing laws barring adultery and non-marital consensual sex, said a report in The Express Tribune on Monday.It has also noted, among hundreds of other recommendations, others which suggest decriminalising such activities, and ensuring punishment for all perpetrators of violence against participants and those who may call for such violence, including members and leaders of jirgas.The UPR recommendations-2017 - copies of which are available with The Express Tribune and online at the UPR's website, show that the first recommendation was given by Canada, and the second by Czechia (formerly the Czech Republic). 'Noted' - Pakistan's response - means that the country would consider this recommendation and take a final decision on either accepting or rejecting it at a later time, officials explained. An official working closely with the Ministry of Human Rights confirmed that the recommendation was officially 'noted'. "Pakistan adopted the third cycle of UPR last month. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) will issue the official document in coming days," they said, adding that the document which is publically available was issued after Pakistan's review in November 2017.The UPR was introduced by the United Nations General Assembly in 2006 and involves a unique process of periodic review of human rights records of all UN member states. The process lets states quantify steps needed for improvement in human rights situations around the globe.In 2008, Pakistan received 51 recommendations, of which it accepted 43 and rejected eight. These eight pertained to the decriminalisation of defamation and non-marital sexual relations, ending abuse of blasphemy laws, legal reforms to ensure punishments in 'honour killings' and the abolition of the death penalty.Many of these were also either noted or accepted in the most recent UPR.At its second UPR in 2012, Pakistan received 167 recommendations, out of which it accepted 126, 'noted' 34 and rejected seven.The recommendations rejected by Pakistan included proposals for repeal of laws related to blasphemy and criminalising non-marital sexual relations, abolition of the death penalty, and bringing an end to the ongoing military operation in Balochistan.While talking to The Express Tribune a human right activist who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue said that Pakistan's response to these recommendations is quite a surprise."Noting the recommendations on decriminalizing adultery and non-marital consensual sex by the Pakistan Government during its recent Universal Periodic Review is shocking. The same recommendations were presented in 2008 UPR but were rejected by the government of Pakistan. We really need to check what forced influenced Pakistan."He believed that there is a disconnect between what happened at the UN and the ground realities in Pakistan."Pakistani officials are showing a liberal face to the west to make them happy, but within the country, they are not even ready to pass and implement laws on issues like child marriage and domestic violence, which shows the double standard of two-faced government officials," said the activist.Officials at the Ministry of Human Rights said they have not yet officially received these recommendations from the Foreign Office.Some of them, however, expressed their views that there are some 'groups' who, based on their vested interests, "do this just for the sake of defaming Pakistan".Meanwhile, Pakistan Ulema Council Chairman Tahir Ashrafi said, "It is impossible to decriminalise adultery in Pakistan as it is against Islam and the Constitution of Pakistan. If the government tries to do so, it would result in a disaster."He said that there are few people who are making efforts to defame Pakistan andIslam."Anyone who does this will face treason charges," he claimed.Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) Chairman Dr Qibla Ayaz said, "It is shocking for all of us to learn that the Pakistani government agreed to even consider this, even though it is impossible to decriminalise such acts in Pakistan."He further said that CII will request the Government of Pakistan to probe the matter and see who is behind it.

Why PM Jawaharlal Nehru refused ? | Only three countries in the world, in 2010 had a majority Hindu population - India, Nepal & Mauritius. Nepal had offered to join the Indian Union after India's independence in 1947. Ex RSS Chief KS Sudarshan had said that it was Independent India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who rejected the offer. "Shortly after independence, the then Nepal Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala had conveyed his country's wish to join India to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru," Mr Sudarshan had said in 2008, while addressing a function. However, Pandit Nehru rejected the offer fearing international criticism that India had turned expansionist immediately after freedom, the Ex RSS Chief had said. India & Nepal signed a bilateral treaty in 1950 establishing a close strategic relationship between the two South Asian neighbours. It is famously called - 'The 1950 India-Nepal Treaty of Peace & Friendship.' The treaty basically offered economic opportunities in India for Nepalese nationals against Nepalese assurances that India's security concerns would be respected. The treaty was signed by the Indian ambassador Chandeshwar Narayan Singh (disrespect for protocol) with Nepal PM Mohan Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana. Rana was left to ponder with a lot, during the last days of his discredited regime.  The treaty which is more than 6 decades old was under threat in the year 2008 when a collation government was formed in Nepal. The leader of the Communist party of Nepal (Maoist) Pushpa Kamal Dahal had said that the 1950 treaty with India would be scrapped and a new pact would be negotiated with India. However, he was not able to pursue the matter & had to resign within 9 months of his tenure. Nehru was also responsible for giving away Tibet to China, without even raising an alarm against China's expansionist policy. Nehru did not speak up even when China tried to stake its claim on Sikkim & Arunachal Pradesh. He wanted the support of the communists & hence decided to keep mum. Jawaharlal Nehru believed in the foreign policy of 'idealism.' Nehru just wanted to please his western counterparts at the UN; some of them may have not bothered to even find Nepal on the world map. In 1951, King Tribhuwan of Nepal fled to India, not because he wanted to but was not left with any option. The democracy in Nepal was under threat & the Rana rule was ready to overpower the king. The king had opposed the Ranas& hence the only option was to support India. Nehru could have used the opportunity to consolidate the Hindu majority, but this was to be the beginning of Nehru's distasteful legacy. India is a country which has never invaded any other country. We do not believe in the expansionist policies practised by countries like China. There are 10 articles in the 1950 treaty & if the need arises the treaty should be negotiated.Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 26 Dec, 9.59 am

"Prime Minister is travelling across the country, but he does not have 15 minutes to give a speech in the Lok Sabha," Rahul Gandhi told reporters here on the second day of his three-day visit to his Parliamantary constituency. "15 minute de dein, khare nahin ho payenge Lok Sabha mein (He will not be able to face the Lok Sabha even for 15 minutes, he will not be able to answer our queries)," he said.  The BJP, however, reacted sharply to Gandhi's remarks saying the Congress leader will do well worrying more about his constituency. "As far as the Prime Minister speaking in the Lok Sabha is considered, Rahul Gandhi will not be able to compete with him," state BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said. Pathak said, "Rahul is in his parliamentary constituency and the people there are questioning him about about the state of the 'adarsh' (ideal) village and what all he has done about the development schemes which he had to support."  As far as facing the Lok Sabha is concerned, all know how Modiji speaks in the Parliament. those who are raising questions on this should self-evaluate as to how long they can sit with full concentration there, Pathak said. Earlier, referring to the Indo-French inter-governmental pact inked in September, 2016 for buying 36 off-the-shelf Dassault Rafale twin-engine fighters for the IAF, Rahul said, "It's a case of direct theft in the Rafale deal. Rs.45,000 crore has been given to an industrialist friend."  To a question, the Congress president said, "Jobs were snatched but the Prime Minister did not speak a word on it. Raking up the issue of alleged embezzlement of over ?13,500 crore from the Punjab National Bank (PNB) by the uncle-nephew duo Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, Gandhi said, "He (the PM) refers to Nirav Modi as Nirav and Mehul Choksi as Mehul bhai and this is a fact. whose good days have come.?"  "Modiji had said good days would come for the people, but the reality is that 'achcey din' have come for only 15 people like Nirav Modi and Muhul Chowksi. For the farmers, labourers and the poor, these are bad days," he asserted. Continuing his attack, Rahul said, "Nirav Modi fled with country's money but the prime minister did not say a word. he took out the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes from the pockets of the common man in the name of demonetisation and put them in the pocket of Nirav Modi."  Later addressing a gathering at Majhgawa in Gauriganj assembly segment of his Lok Sabha constituency, Rahul said his party wanted all-round development of Amethi but the Modi government took away most of the projects including IIIT, mega food park and the paper mill which would have provided employment to thousands of youth. He, however, promised that he would again try to bring back some projects, including the food park, in the interest of local youths. "Unless youths are employed, the country will not progress up to mark," he said. In a meeting with a committee for establishment of a university in Amethi, he said he would make another effort in this regard. Rahul said he had already written a letter to the HRD Minister for it. He laid the foundation stone of some projects including establishment of a community centre at Majhgawa in Jamo block. Gandhi attended the District Vigilance and Monitoring Committee meeting at Gauriganj collectorate.  He discussed issues related to MGNREGA, potable water, road construction with the officials concerned and asked them to complete all the pending projects while ensuring that quality was maintained. He announced the installation of RO plants in all government inter colleges for girls and overhead water tanks on toilets' roofs from his MPLAD funds.

It is now taken care of by the Parsi residents of the area.  After many decades and renovations, this place is currently known as the library for senior citizens. Albeit the very culture of reading books is long lost, Albert Edward Library continues to preserve the charm through a massive collection of 20,000 books across categories such as history, fiction, non-fiction, art, culture and Marathi.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

In ancient times, mermaids were considered to be beautiful female creatures, alluring and gentle. We all have seen these creatures in films and cartoons series ad enjoyed a lot. We also have heard people about their existence which has made the topic interesting to debate on. But then the question arises about their existence. Are they real ? On the Norfolk Beach in England, remains of a mermaid has found by a man who claims that the dead species was a mermaid.    Paul took some pictures of it which went viral on social media. There was a debate regarding existence of mermaid or is it just a Photoshop image ? Are we still unaware of the nature ?   According to the news, Paul has claimed that he has seen the remains of the creature which exactly looked like mermaid. One story, dating back to the 1600s, claimed that a mermaid had entered Holland through a dike, and was injured in the process. She was taken to a nearby lake and was soon nursed back to health.  Many people are saying that it is just dead seal, some believe that it is just a dummy that is designed for shooting. It has been believed that These creatures lure sailors look like half bird beautiful creatures which can be seen on the rocky shoals.  There is another picture which is viral on internet. It is believed that this mermaid was found dead on the shore of the sea. However, many people claim that this was just a dummy which was used in a film shooting.  According to the information on the internet, mermaids are seen in many different locations in the world but so far no evidences have been found to believe that these things are based on truth.  There was one more shocking news about the findings of remains of a mermaid and it was a rumour that this would be kept in museum but till now it is not hence proved that it was remains of a mermaid or not.  Citizens of Israel have also seen mermaid in 2009 and this news went viral. Existence of these creatures had been in discussions and debates since ages. These half animals and half human beings are animal legends that have captured human images for ages.    The mayor of the city claimed that whosoever would prove the existence of mermaid, he/she would be rewarded with $ 1 Million. People were excited first about searching for mermaid as this was the most mysterious story to reveal and in the greed of money they started diving in the sea but nobody till date has proved their existence.  Another story, from 1830 in Scotland, claimed that a young boy killed a mermaid by throwing rocks at it; the creature looked like a child of about 3 or 4, but had a salmon's tail instead of legs. The villagers are said to have buried it in a coffin, though there seems to be no historical evidence of this fishy tale.      Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 05 Oct, 11.37 am

Vu is also an old player in India that offers smart TVs at very affordable prices. So, here is a comparison of 32-inch smart TVs from all the three manufacturers. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Price in India The 32-inch Xiaomi Mi TV 4A was launched in India on 7th March 2018, and it costs Rs. 13,999, making it one of the most affordable smart HD TVs in India. The 32-inch Thomson LED Smart TV was launched in India yesterday, and it costs Rs. 13,490. The 32-inch Vu LED Smart TV is the costliest TV among all with a price tag of Rs. 15,999. The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A, as well as the Thomson Smart TV, are sold through online flash sales. The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A can be bought from Mi Store and Flipkart, whereas the Thomson Smart TV is currently being sold only through Flipkart. The next flash sale for the Mi TV 4A is set for 12 PM on 17th April 2018, whereas the next flash sale of the Thomson Smart TV is set to take place at 12 PM on 18th April 2018. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Display All the three TVs feature a 32-inch LED display with HD resolution (1366 x 768 resolution) and 60Hz refresh rate. All the three TVs also have a viewing angle of 178 degrees. The Thomson Smart TV and Vu Smart TV are rated for 450 nits of brightness, whereas Xiaomi hasn't provided max brightness figure. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Features The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A is powered by a quad-core Amlogic processor mated with 1GB of RAM. The TV also has 8GB of internal storage. The Mi TV 4A runs on a heavily customised version of the Android operating system, and it features Patchwall. The Patchwall merges content from all the media-streaming applications and set-top boxes in one pane. The Patchwall makes navigating and searching through the content easy. The Mi TV 4A also comes with an easy to use 12-button remote. The remote works on Bluetooth. Hence, the user doesn't need to direct the remote towards the TV for proper operation. The Thomson LED Smart TV features a 64-bit processor, 1GB of RAM, and 8GB of internal storage. The TV runs on a customised version of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. The TV comes pre-loaded with a bunch of media-streaming apps like YouTube and Netflix. There is also an app store built into the TV, from where the users can download apps. The Thomson LED Smart TV supports Miracast for mirroring content from the smartphone to the TV. The Vu LED Smart TV runs on the Android operating system, and Vu calls it as PremiumSmart OS. Vu hasn't revealed the make and model of the processor used in the TV. The TV comes pre-loaded with Netflix and YouTube. There is also an app store from where the users can download the available applications and games. The bundled remote comes with dedicated Netflix and YouTube button. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Connectivity The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A has three HDMI ports, one AV input, two USB 2.0 ports, one 3.5mm audio out, and one Ethernet port. The Vu Smart LED TV also has the same connectivity options. The Thomson LED Smart TV also features three HDMI ports, two USB 2.0 ports, one 3.5mm audio jack, and one ethernet port, but it misses out on AV input. As for the wireless connectivity, all the three TVs have Wi-Fi b/g/n, but only the Mi TV 4A comes with Bluetooth connectivity option. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Verdict From hardware specifications perspective, there isn't much difference between the three TVs; they have same spec display panels, same speaker output wattage, and almost similar connectivity options. However, the Mi TV 4A is a step further than the other two TVs with its Bluetooth connectivity and Patchwall feature. We think that going with the Mi TV 4A would be a wise choice.

If not, then we are here to tell you about him. The answer is Lord Parshuram. The birth anniversary of Parshuram is being celebrated in the country on 18 April 2018 i.e. today. According to the Hindu calendar, he was born on the third day of Shukla Paksha of Hindu month i.e. Vaisakh. It is the believed that people who do virtue on this auspicious day never ends.

This made Parshuram Ji angry and started fighting with Ganesha. Later, Lord Ganesha was winning handily, but then Parashurama threw his axe which broke a tusk of Lord Ganesha.  As per the beliefs of people, Parshuram Ji wanted to thanks Lord Shiva for giving him the power to fight with the enemies. Therefore, he went to Mount Kailash to pay his homage to the Lord. Well, it is known by everyone that once upon a time, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati asked their both sons Ganesha and Kartikeya to circled the world three times and who would come back first would get it as a prize. Finally, Lord Ganesha won the race by taking the rounds of his parents. Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 18 Apr, 1.40 pma week ago2 days ago4 weeks ago3 weeks ago

After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am

The 54 years old actress died due to accidental drowning in a bathtub in a hotel in Dubai. None of us ever imagined, that she will left the world so soon. The entire nation mourned on the sudden death of the diva who ruled the silver screen for more than three decades. Thousands of fans gathered on the street of Mumbai to bid farewell to their favorite superstars. Her death has raised lots of speculations. Now, another shocking detail has come out in open. In a recent interview, Sridevi's uncle, Venugopal Reddy revealed a few unknown things about her life. He said that Sridevi was living a miserable life with Boney Kapoor and she was not happy at all. He further added that Boney's mother never liked Sridevi and she was not happy with their marriage.     Born in a middle-class family, Sridevi became a star and married a famous producer, but according to her uncle, their financial condition wasn't that good. He said, "What we knew was Boney Kapoor lost a lot of money in few films and they sold Sridevi's properties to make up for the losses. And Sridevi always had that pain in her heart. Sridevi lived in pain and passed away with a lot of pain in her heart. She was not at peace. She wore a smile on her face for the world, but she went through a lot inside her. Boney produced a film which never saw the light of the day, and they were financially going through a tough phase. Sridevi sold her properties and cleared those debts to get life back on track. And that was the main reason why Sridevi got back to acting in films."   Venugopal also revealed that the actress went under the knife to enhance her features. He said, "Yes. she did get a couple of surgeries done on her nose. She traveled to the US and got the surgeries done on her nose since she wanted it to look good. We got to know this when we casually ask about her well-being while speaking to her mother over the phone."    Talking about Sridevi and Srilatha's differences, Venugopal revealed, "When her mother was operated in the US, the doctors performed the surgery on the wrong side of her brain because of which she was totally bedridden. She was alive but not in her senses. She had become just an object. After the family got to know about the surgery, they filed a case against the hospital and Boney Kapoor was along with Sridevi during this process. And court penalised the hospital, and sisters, Sridevi and Srilatha, had few differences in the allocation of that amount which was later cleared by the family members. And besides a share in this compensation, Sridevi used to send a lot of money to her sister Srilatha and they were fine."    He also shared Sridevi's equation with her step-son, Arjun Kapoor. He shared, "Sridevi did mention to few of her relatives that she did face few challenges with Arjun Kapoor, but I'm not too sure about it. When few of our relatives paid a visit to Sridevi, during their conversation she did mention that she was worried about daughters Janhvi and Khushi, about their future. Sridevi also mentioned that Boney wasn't well and his health was a bit worrying," Well, the truth behind Venugopal's story is true or not, we can't tell.

Koul submitted his resignation to the office of Director General Police (DGP) S.P. Vaid and Home Secretary R.K.Goel On Friday. They added that Koul has pleaded that he be relieved at the earliest since his career has remained stuck for the last more than 10 years due to delay in cadre review of KPS. As per norms, it would take few more days before Javed Koul’s resignation is accepted and he is relieved of the services.  Javed Koul is 1999 batch KPS officer who was promoted as SSP on July 8, 2014 i.e after having put-in 15 years of service in the police services. He has served on various important positions in the state but like many other KPS officers was repeatedly requesting the state government to look into their grievances and redress them at the earliest. The government constituted a committee which is still looking into the cadre review issue of the KPS officers but has not taken any decision. Koul decided not to wait any more and submitted his resignation, said a source. He added that Koul is likely to be followed by some other KPS officers who too are mulling the option of going for pre-mature retirement since they too see their career prospects getting marred in KPS. It needs to be mentioned here that KPS is one of the feeding services of the Kashmir Administrative Service (KAS) like Revenue, Excise and Taxation, Accounts, etc., to which candidates are selected based on merit-cum-preference in the Jammu and Kashmir Combined Competitive Services. However, the general complaint is the KPS have never been categorised as a state cadre service, resulting in poor management of its cadre strength and professional stagnation. Home Department had envisaged bringing KPS officers on a par with KAS officers in matters of promotion and pay grades. It was proposed that like KAS officers who are promoted to the rank of Administrative Secretary without being inducted into the IAS cadre, KPS officers too would be promoted to DIG and IG ranks irrespective of their induction into the IPS cadre. The posts of Administrative Secretary and IGP are equivalent with respect to their pay grade. KPS cadres, who are middle-rung police officers, are engaged in keeping law and order as well as fighting militancy on the ground. But such is the stagnation that several of them who are currently in the rank of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), remain in the pay grade of selection grade Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP). Some KPS officers who retired as SSPs were, in fact, selection grade DySPs. The J&K Gazetted Police Service Rules provide for a DySP to don the rank of SSP after completing 15 years of service. KPS officers are seeking parity with their counterparts in the KAS and feeding services. They argue that they have passed the same J&K Combined Services Competitive Examination and, depending upon their preference in their application forms, were posted as DySPs in the police organisation. Subject to vacancies, 25% of these KPS officers, after 5 years of service, are promoted to Selection Grade DySPs. After 5 years of service and depending on vacancies, Selection Grade DySPs are promoted as SPs who, after completing 5 years of service, are promoted as SSPs. The next rank is that of Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police, subject to the officer’s induction into the IPS cadre. However, these promotions are made from among direct KPS appointees and departmental promotees on a 50:50 basis. The first batch of KAS and KPS officers was recruited in 1971-72 through the J&K Combined Services Competitive Examination held by the Jammu and Kashmir State Public Service Commission. Direct recruitment of the second and third batches happened in 1977 and 1984. No exams were held for nearly the next 15 years, and the fourth batch of direct KPS recruits came in 1999. However, facing a requirement for middle-rung officers to tackle militancy, the government promoted a large number of Inspectors as DySPs. As large-scale promotions from 1984-99 far exceeded the 50% quota fixed for induction of departmental promotees to the KPS cadre, the 1999 batch of direct KPS appointees and the batches that followed them began to demand the correction of the seniority list. Both direct appointees and departmental promotee KPS officers went to court, resulting in the non-induction of KPS officers into the IPS cadre from 2008. In the absence of promotion of any KPS officer from the rank of SSP to DIG during all these years, nearly 50 IPS cadre posts to be filled by departmental promotees lay vacant. The problem became more acute after the Omar Abdullah government decided in June 2014 to enhance the retirement age of its employees from 58 years to 60 years. As a result, a number of KPS officers got two more years of service, making the stagnation problem more acute among the directly appointed KPS officers, who were forced to see their batchmates in the KAS and feeding services occupy ranks much higher than theirs. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had moved a proposal on December 9, 2016. Following differences, state government had on December 15, 2016 constituted 6-member cabinet sub-committee headed by Minister for Industries and Commerce Chander Prakash Ganga to examine the proposal regarding review of the strength and composition of the Jammu and Kashmir Police (Gazetted) Service. Other five members of the sub-committee include the Minister for Health and Medical Education Bali Bhagat, Minister for Forests Choudhary Lal Singh, the Minister for Finance Haseeb Drabu, the Minister for CAPD Choudhary Zulfikar Ali and the Minister for PWD Naeem Akhtar. The committee is yet to submit its report.     Source            Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 17 May, 12.25 pm

Our social narrative resonates with multiples cultures and practices and we are downright proud of that. To be a true Indian however, you need to mouth the profanities like a boss for fitting in. Turns out, using cuss words are not only college students but they are really stress-busting and helps vent your anger in a better way. What’s more ridiculous, we ask someone to teach us their swear words first to get a hang of their culture before we learn their language. This is the spirit of India and here we have assembled a number of cuss words from different languages of India that will make you go ROFL: Hindi: Behenchod- It means sister fucker. Since incest is equal to committing sin in our country, this gaali is a serious annoyer.   Assamese: Kela- Kela in Assamese is suggestive of dick. Kela means Banana in general which has resemblance to, well you know. Nagori Putek- Son of a bastard . These two words contain half the greeting.  Bengali: Khankir chele- Son of a whore. This gaali  will drive a Bengali nuts and we hear the bus drivers hurling it at each other in a busy traffic. Bokachoda- Stupid fucker. This is a landmark gaali in Bengali which we attempt at someone lovingly too sometimes. Bengalis are equally into profanity like intellectual debates on Art, culture and literature.  Gujarati: Bhosad Pappu: idiot with a pussy. Chodhru: Dumbass These two gaalis are staples in Gujarati language both in irritation and salutation.  Kannada: Dagaar: Bitch Nin Hendruna Kaiya: Dumbass.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/youngisthan-epaper-youngeng/why+lord+krishna+never+married+radha-newsid-74055101|  Home Why Lord Krishna Never Married Radha | Radha and Krishna - Without Radha, Krishna is incomplete and without Krishna, Radha cannot be complete. Modern-day couples have been inspired by the eternal love story of Radha and Krishna. Even after so many eras, heavenly couple Radha-Krishna is worshipped together not only by youths but by everyone. With Krishna, Radha is considered to be the supreme goddess as she is said to command Lord Krishna. Listening to krishna and radha enchanting love story, many of the devotees end up thinking why Lord Krishna never married Radha.    According to various researches and studies conducted, it is said that Lord Krishna never married Radha as he believed; love and marriage are two different things. According to the Vedas, Krishna believed that marriage is an agreement or arrangement while love is a selfless emotion where you pledge to love someone with purified nature. Radha and Krishna love story is an exemplary for teens where he says marriage is materialistic.  Furthermore, Radha was in love with Krishna so much that she believed Krishna was God and she used to love him as a devotee. She was lost in 'bhakti love' which people started mistaking as a physical love. Radha and Krishna love is taken as a relationship between a devotee and God.     Radha and Krishna are not separate  According to the facts believed, Radha is not separate from Krishna. Lord Krishna has various types of energies and you need two individuals to get married. Also, Radha is Lord Krishna's energy which pleases him. Therefore it is believed that Radha and Krishna are two different manifestations of the divine principle.    In order to show that Radha and Krishna relationship was not physical but it was actually the eminent level of love between the two, Lord Krishna did not marry Radha. It is said that it was the highest devotion of love expressed by a human (Radha) to Lord Krishna (The God). According to the Vedic scriptures, the love shared between Radha and Krishna cannot be compared to any other mythological or love stories from history. One more story supports the idea which says Radha refused to marry Krishna because she felt she doesn't fit in the place. According to Radha, people would never want Lord Krishna to marry a cowgirl. They would surely want Lord Krishna to marry a princess. However, Lord Krishna reassured Radha about the marriage and her status in the society, but she was firm in her decision. Also, there is one more theory which says that because Krishna and Radha are one soul, Krishna says that how can he marry his own soul. He explained the world that Krishna and Radha are one and not different from each other in existence or spirit. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 29 Sep, 12.35 pm

Honda took the wraps off the X-Blade at the Auto Expo 2018. It is powered by the same 162.71cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine as the Unicorn 160 and makes 14PS of max power and 13.9Nm of peak torque. It comes mated to a 5-speed gearbox. Expect it to hit showrooms in March with a price tag between Rs 75,000 - Rs 80,000 (ex-showroom). Read more about the Honda X-Blade here.X-Blade Adventure  After unveiling the X-Blade, Honda then moved on to showcase the X-Blade Adventure. Over the standard bike, it gets a larger windshield, a pair of crash guards and a sturdy carrier that replaces the pillion grab rail. The Adventure also has faux carbon fibre accents on the body around the fuel cap. But there is a catch. Honda may offer the accessories as additional fitment on the standard model, but only if the response at the expo is good. The company might also sell an "Adventure" kit that turns your X-Blade into a mild adventure tourer. Activa 5G  As promised, Honda launched the fourth model for the 2017-18 fiscal year, the 5th generation Honda Activa. Called the Activa 5G, the new scooter gets LED headlights, a remote seat-opening button and a semi-digital instrument console. Apart from that, it remains identical to the 4G in terms of both styling and mechanicals. Prices will be out in a matter of weeks and we are expecting a premium of Rs 2,000 over the 4G.2018 CBR250R  It's here! Honda has reintroduced the CBR250R in India. It has now undergone a BSIV update and updates like an LED headlamp and fresh graphics. Other than that, everything from the mechanics to the hardware has remained identical to the older bike. The CBR250R will now have a new rival in the market in the form of the TVS Apache RR 310. Expect the price to be close to the older model.  2017 MotoGP Bike  The Honda RC213V MotoGP race bike ridden by the 2017 champion Marc Marquez was on display at the Expo. It is powered by a 1000cc V4 motor that makes more than 241PS of power. For one season, a rider is given 7 of these powerplants, which the team has to use in 18 races. Specs aside, just standing next to the MotoGP-winning bike gives you goosebumps.PCX Electric Scooter  From the array of products at the Honda pavilion, the one which stood out was the PCX electric scooter. Powered by a high performance electric motor, which has been developed in-house by Honda, the PCX uses Honda's Mobile Power Pack with swappable batteries, charged separately. You can even attach two of these battery packs under the seat to get a longer range. While this is still a concept, Honda actually plans to employ this technology in its future electric products, which is pretty cool.  2018 CB Hornet 160R  As a part of the 2018 update, the CB Hornet 160R now gets LED headlights and new graphics. The fully digital instrument console, the sporty fuel tank, tank extensions and the chunky exhaust muffler remain unchanged. The X-shaped LED tail lamp has also been retained from the earlier model. No change in the power figures either.2018 CBR1000RR  Launched last year, the CBR1000RR Fireblade costs Rs 17.61 lakhs (ex-showroom Delhi) and is brought in as a completely built unit (CBU) in India. The 2017 CBR1000RR has 191 restless horses under that gorgeous exterior, which is 11 more than the older generation. Rivaling the Fireblade is the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R, Yamaha R1, BMW S1000 RR, Aprilia RSV4 and the Ducati 1299 Panigale. The CBR1000RR currently costs 17.3 lakh but could get cheaper thanks to the new duty reduction on CBU bikes . Get more details about the bike here . 2018 Goldwing  Also standing tall at the Honda pavilion was the 2018 Honda Goldwing. Launched at the very end of 2017, the flagship Honda for the country is priced at Rs 26.85 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). It is available in two variants - Gold Wing and Gold Wing Tour. The Goldwing Tour commands a price of Rs 28.49 lakh and gets a trunk, heated seats, electronic rear suspension preload and traction control. Both these bikes are only available in the showcased Candy Ardent red shade.CBR 250 One Make  The CBR 250 one make series bike also made an appearance at the Auto Expo. It is also a part of the ARRC racing series which travels around Asia. Apart from the obvious bodywork modifications the race bike also gets HRC's race ECU, which allows the team to use custom maps and also provides a 15 per cent power bump over the road bike. The bike also gets a host of track-spec features like a quickshifter, pit lane limiter and a shift light indicator.2018 Africa Twin  While all the mechanical parts remain the same the 2018 Africa Twin showcased at the Auto Expo had a few tricks up its sleeve. The showcased model had features like ride by wire with 3 rider modes, 2.3 kg-lighter battery, stainless steel spoke wheels, brand new instrument cluster, off-road-focused footpegs and a new emergency stop signal in the rear indicators. Prices for the 2018 model will be revealed soon. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 15 Feb, 4.02 pma week ago7 days ago3 weeks ago3 weeks ago2 weeks ago

The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils.

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/welthi-epaper-welthi/world+health+day+structural+problems+in+indian+healthcare+system-newsid-85199675| Home World Health Day: Structural problems in Indian healthcare system | Healthcare is considered to be an important benchmark for development index for any country. Unfortunately, even after 70 years of independence, affordable quality healthcare facilities for the common Indians are still a myth. It doesn't imply that technological advancement in India in healthcare is not up to the mark; rather there a sharp contrast in mass healthcare as affordability has become a serious issue. Rural population of India, which comprises of 70% of the total population, is still deprived of the latest innovations and technologies in healthcare.   Be it the ever increasing supply-demand gap, low insurance penetration or costly treatment of terminal diseases - there is an urgent need to relook the healthcare sector at present. The proposals of National Health Policy under Ayushman Bharat announced in Union Budget 2018 definitely look to be promising from a bigger perspective. Although the budget has allocated Rs 1200 crore for a major overhaul, still there is amid food for thought. The lack of skilled health personnel in both urban and rural sector is a critical issue in India including front line health workers, mid level care providers and allied health professionals. No doubt, PPP model can be a good alternative to existing system. Side by side, strategic purchasing along with maintaining standard management guidelines, negotiating costs and consistent monitoring of Healthcare service provided can definitely change the scenario.  According to Mr Nageswaran C K , Facility Director , Fortis Malar Hospital, Chennai ," The existing healthcare infrastructure is just not enough to meet the needs of the population. There is no enough supply of operating beds -, especially in smaller towns. In smaller towns doctors and the patient ratio is low. Lack of trained nurses and primary health centers is also one of the basic problems in Indian healthcare infrastructure and tertiary health centers are mainly in large cities. The Medico-legal issues still plague the doctors. There are also high import duties for high-end medical equipment and consumables making the investment very high and there is a lack of infrastructure for end-of- life care. There is no subsidy on land, power, and other inputs for private hospitals - but the tremendous pressure to keep prices low. Anyhow, the primary need is to strengthen the infrastructure in smaller towns and rural areas. The government should also encourage and incentivize the doctors to work in rural areas. According to Dr. Usha Manjunath, Director IIHMR,"National Health Protection Mission is a positive step, but implementation is tough and time lines for positive impact are difficult to be predicted. With increasing use of high end technology in everyday practice is further pushing the healthcare costs up. Essential medical drugs and technologies is another key aspect of healthcare infrastructure. Success of Jan Aushadhi in some areas needs to be replicated across the nation. Price regulation of medical products and drugs continue to be taken up. Health Information System, data quality, accuracy, completeness, security and integration issues still need to be addressed. We have a long way to go in using HIS for evidence based public health programmes, measuring of outputs/outcomes, EMR and Clinical Information Systems. A lacuna in Leadership from political to organizational levels across public and private health sector is hindering all aspects of health system functioning in the country. "In India, barring the Centers of Excellence, both in the Central and State level, most other government hospitals lag behind private ones. In terms of service to the community, government hospitals are overcrowded and maintenance of infrastructure of facilities and hygiene is poor. Comparatively, decision making for purchase, maintenance and utilization of medical equipment is much better in private hospitals. Recruitment of medical personnel is specialty care is difficult in government hospitals especially in smaller towns and remote areas.. Implementation of regulatory mechanisms and quality control is highly variable in most hospitals. Thus a far sighted approach with regard to basic healthcare infrastructure can definitely bridge the gap between urban and rural spheres and definitely help India in affordable quality healthcare, which can pave a new path in medical tourism too.

Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Arpita Khan Sharma, who considered as the most loved sister of 'Khandaan.' We have always seen Salman Khan and his family shower love and care on this 28-year-old daughter of their family. The entire fans of Bollywood admire the Khandaan for being such a sweet family. Arpita Khan Sharma who turned 28 on August 1, despite never being a part of Hindi Films, has always been a popular name among the fans of Bollywood. She has always been the talk of the town, for all the good reasons of course. Arpita who is the youngest sister of Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail Khan, is very close to her brother and especially an apple of Salman's eye. When the news of Arpita wedding with her longtime boyfriend Ayush Sharma surfaced, it made it to the headlines of all the leading newspapers, mags and channels.  Needless to say, that when it came to his adorable sister Arpita's wedding, Salman and the entire 'Khandaan' didn't leave a stone unturned to make it a fairytale one. So, on this auspicious occasion of Rakhi, we are here to tell you something about the most fortunate sister of tinsel town. Here are some lesser-known facts about Arpita Khan Sharma's life, we bet you didn't know.  Arpita was born on August 1, 1989. Despite not being a biological daughter of Salim Khan, she has always been the most loved member of their family.   It is said that Arpita was adopted by Salman's parents Salim and Salma Khan. There are different stories around in the media, around her adoption.   While some say that Arpita's mother was a beggar and lived on a footpath. She died right after giving birth to Arpita. And Salim and Salma spotted this infant near her dead body on the footpath they were passing by. Hence, they brought her home along and decided to make her a part of their family forever.   The reports in the media also state that Salim's second wife Helen was the one who adopted Arpita. This is how Arpita became an Angel from an orphan.  Very few people know that Arpita has really got a great fashion sense. She is a fashion graduate from London College Of Fashion and holds a degree in fashion marketing and management.   Before Arpita got married to Ayush Sharma, she used to work for an architectural and interior designing firm. This Beti of 'Khandaan' dreams of owning her own fashion brand one day.  In the year 2014, Arpita got a tattoo of a star, which contains the names of all her family members. The tattoo has got Salim Khan, mothers Salma and Helen, brothers Salman, Arbaaz. Sohail, sister Alvira and friend Deeksha.   This isn't much known that when Arpita dated Arjun Kapoor for two years. When Arpita and Arjun were in a relationship Arjun weighed 140 Kgs. But fate had some other plans for this couple. Arjun and Arpita broke up and the reason for their split is still not known. Seems like their break up didn't affect Arjun's terms with Khandaan and especially Salman Khan, Coz he is still close to that family.  Once again, cupid struck Arpita when she met Delhi based businessman, Ayush Sharma. Ayush hails from Delhi and belongs to a royal family. Unlike Arpita, Ayush has got plans to make Bollywood debut soon.  Arpita's wedding with Ayush Sharma is considered as the most expensive wedding of B-town. If the reports are to be believed, Arpita always wanted to get married in a palace. Ergo, Salman who can make all possible efforts to make his sister's wish come true booked the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad for her wedding. Her fairytale wedding was a Star studded affair.  Arpita is now happily married to Ayush and gave birth to a baby, Ahil, in March 2016. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 14 Aug, 6.41 am

Maharaja Sayajirao University - Baroda   MSU of Baroda is a great university for studying arts. It has been ranked among the top 10 universities for arts in India.

Lemos, 37, along with his senior accounts specialist, Ryan de Souza, 25, were convicted of duping thousands of investors in a Ponzi scheme that offered investors annual returns of 120 percent on a minimum investment of $25,000 through his company Exential. Initially, the company paid profits but stopped paying its investors after the scheme collapsed in March 2016 and the company's offices were shut down by the Dubai Economic Department in July 2016.  Lemos's wife Valany Cardozo said that she has still not given up hope, despite the 500 year sentence.  "The only reason he got convicted is because of the number of complaints (513 cases) filed against him," Cardozo said. Cardozo also denied the allegations that they ran a Ponzi scheme, and said that they encountered a problem due to the closure of one of their bank accounts.  "It was a genuine problem and my husband promised to solve it. But the team leader in the company together with our competitors and some lawyers got together and brainwashed clients. They filed complaints and this kept escalating," claimed Cardozo. A case has also been registered against Cardozo, for illegally entering the sealed office in December 2017 and taking out documents. Lemon gained prominence in 2015 when his company FC Prime Markets became the principal sponsor of FC Goa, the Goan franchise in the Indian Super League of domestic football. He got easy access to famous personalities through his association with the league, including with Sachin Tendulkar, Abhishek Bachchan and Ranbir Kapoor and even international football icons such as Ronaldinho.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/asian+age-epaper-asianage/hindi+films+try+too+hard+to+become+everything+says+shekhar+kapur-newsid-85684113| Bollywood News Hindi films try too hard to become everything, says Shekhar Kapur | The veteran filmmaker singled out regional films, particularly Malayalam cinema, at the 65th National Film Awards announcement.  Mumbai: Impressed by regional cinema, director Shekhar Kapur, who headed the feature film jury of this year's National Film Awards, says Hindi film industry needs to pull up its socks. The veteran filmmaker singled out regional films, particularly Malayalam cinema, at the 65th National Film Awards announcement yesterday. When asked whether a divide still exists between the mainstream and regional cinema, Kapur told PTI, "I think Hindi cinema should now become regional cinema."  "The standard of performances in some of the regional films is completely stunning. Hindi films cannot compete with them, not in the state they are... And I know why... Our Hindi films try too hard to become everything. These (regional films) are rooted," the director said while announcing the name of the winners.  Jayaraj won his second best director award -- this time for Malayalam film "Bhayanakam". He also won the best adapted screenplay award. Fahadh Faasil won the best supporting actor award for Malayalam film "Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum". The movie also won the award for best Malayalam film and took home the honour in best original screenplay category. Santhosh Raman got the award for best production design for "Take Off". Its actor Parvathy received a special mention. Kapur, known for films such as "Mr India" and "Bandit Queen", said after having served in the jury, he is ready to come back home and make movies in India. In the late '90s, the 72-year-old director turned to Hollywood and made award-winning films such as "Elizabeth" and "Elizabeth: The Golden Age". "My last film in India was 'Bandit Queen'. It was for a reason that I didn't make films in India. I wanted to make better films here. For years, I've been watching films and thinking that 'Nah... the standard of Hindi films is not that good. "I thought, 'Why should I go back? It should move forward and take up newer challenges'. But after 10 days of watching these films, talking to my jury members, I want to make a film in India." Kapur said films recognised at the National Awards were supposed to be enjoyed by both audiences and critics. "Awards are given not only to highlight the work done by the filmmakers, they are also given so that audiences actually go and watch the films. These films are not just meant to be viewed by film critics. "Why only allow the film critics to see the films? There is a very thin line between prejudice and judgement. Film critics are usually very prejudiced. You must watch these films. A lot of people have done a lot of hard work," he said.

In fact, there are people who will not venture into a room if they see a lizard in it (raises hand in admission). Though they are harmless (I find that difficult to believe) household pests, they have a lot of bad press attached to them. Also, they make good subject for superstitions as well. Apparently, if the poor lizard happens to fall on you it's trying to tell you something (how about the lizard just lost its balance?). Did you know a lizard falling on certain body parts mean certain things? It only goes to show these reptiles are not very good with staying on the ceilings.  Heck, whatever a lizard does has some meaning!  Scouring through the database of all things weird this is what we came up with  #The study of falling of lizards is called Gauli shastra. According to this shastra, every movement of a lizard holds significance and there are not less than 65 places where the lizard will fall on the human body that would foretell good and bad omens. #If you happen to see two lizards mating it means you are going to meet an old friend, if you seem them quarrelling you will also pick fight with someone. #If you see a dead lizard while moving into a new house, it could mean bad luck and illness for your family. On the contrary, some people believe seeing a lizard in the new house means Goddess Lakshmi is visiting them. #The lizard must know on which side to fall: Lizard falling on your right arm means elevation in society or a sensual adventure ahead and on your left arm means you are going to lose money. It is considered auspicious if the lizard falls on the right body parts of man and left body parts in women. For both it means different things. #The most common one, in the north if a lizard falls on your head it means good luck and if it falls on your forehead it means you will have a disease while some say it brings wealth. In the south people believe that if a lizard falls on the head then it means ill luck and in some cases even death. For example there is a story that a lizard fell on Chief Minister Biju Patnaik, just before elections in 2009, and he came back to power.​ #The lizard on the right and left shoulders mean victory and peace and happiness respectively. #If the thing decides to take a tour of your body, well, it seems it is wishing you a long life. #It is difficult to term what noise a lizard makes- is it twittering, is it chirping, or is it clucking? Anyway, so what does it mean when you hear a lizard's call? I would say it's just conversing with its mates but then humans also have an explanation for that as well. In Malayalam movies at least, if a lizard calls when you are saying something then it means that you are telling the truth and that is bound to happen. #To wash off all the ill luck that comes from touching a lizard or it falling on a person, one needs to visit Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram, where one can touch the golden Lizard, the silver lizard along with the sun and moon images on the roof, behind the sanctum sanctorum. When one touches them it is believed to remove all ill-effects or doshas caused due to the falling of lizards in the past and in future.  While we do not endorse any of these and do not wish lizards to fall on you, there are actually mentions of the lizard and its calls and more on its significance in Hinduism, Vedas and South Indian holy scriptures.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Besides, Air India Express has around 555 slots at different local and overseas airports.  Moving ahead with the strategic disinvestment of Air India, the Civil Aviation Ministry has unveiled the broad contours for the process, including that the government would sell 76 per cent stake as well as transfer management control.  The low cost international arm Air India Express would be put up for sale apart from the national carrier's stake in AISATS, an equal joint venture with Singapore-based SATS.  Attractive slots at capacity-constrained airports and opportunities to increase international market share are among the highlights of Air India and Air India Express, as per the preliminary information memorandum issued on Wednesday for the proposed divestment.  In the voluminous preliminary information memorandum, the ministry has cited various 'key investment highlights' for the two carriers, including about slots.  Citing "under-utilised bilateral rights", it said there is huge potential for growth and increasing share in international markets. There is also "scope for improvement in utilisation of bilateral rights".  According to the memorandum, the two airlines have attractive slots at capacity constrained airports in the country.  "This is a significant advantage compared to any new player looking to enter or an existing looking to expand into the Indian market," the ministry said.  The national airline has 3,739 domestic slots and 2,543 international slots available per week as on December 31, 2017. In the Gulf and Middle East region alone, the carrier has around 280 slots available at various airports, including Abu Dhabi, Jeddah, Tel Aviv and Muscat.  During the same period, Air India Express had 555 slots at different domestic and international airports.  At the end of December 2017, Air India had an operating fleet of 115 aircraft while Air India Express had 23 planes.  The existing debt and liabilities of Air India and Air India Express as on March 31, 2017 would be re-allocated.  "It is expected that debt and liabilities, including net current liabilities of Rs 88,160 million, aggregating to Rs 3,33,920 million will remain with AI and AIXL (no change for AI-SATS except in normal course of business). This number shall be further adjusted to account for material business developments post March 31, 2017 for instance purchases/ delivery of aircraft etc.  "The balance debt shall be allocated to Air India Asset Holding Limited which is 100 per cent owned by the Government of India subject to receipt of requisite approvals from lenders and regulators, as applicable," the memorandum said. Contingent liabilities would remain with Air India and Air India Express.  Within the contingent liabilities, income tax, customs duty, as well as service tax and guarantee fee/ penal charges due to the government would continue to remain with Air India. There would be the "government commitment to make it good/indemnify in case the liabilities are confirmed against Air India," it added.  The last date for submission of Expression of Interest (EoI) is May 14 and intimation to the qualified interest bidders would be made on May 28.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/yourstory-epaper-yourstory/from+techie+to+exceptional+trainer+ramya+arun+s+workdays+are+fun+days-newsid-85963744?mode=pw| Home From techie to exceptional trainer, Ramya Arun's workdays are fun days |  Spurred on by her dream, she transformed herself from being one among a million to one in a million. A #PassionToPaycheck story.  A happy-go-lucky S Ramya Arun followed the usual software engineer career path after her a degree in Information Technology. Working for a global leader in the IT services, she had everything going for her but still felt a lack of fulfilment. Ramya, being a peoples' person, hated the fact that her work was limited to coding and managing data on the computer. Right through her college days she had loved motivating her peers and family, particularly when they were down in the dumps and needed support. Training came naturally to her and even in her workplace she volunteered to train her associates. "I feel alive and happy interacting with people rather than computers." At the back of her mind, she knew that her true calling was a career in training.   That now-or-never moment  It was when she was offered a project in Germany that she decided to quit. "I realised that it was now or never. If I ended up taking the project, I'd be stuck in a job that I didn't love. Though the money was good I'd end up miserable." Sometimes the universe does conspire to lead one to what one desires the most. "I saw a newspaper advert of Indian Academy of Training and Development offering 'Train the trainer course' for training and coaching. I went through a few reviews and attended the introductory workshop by the Director, Dr Rajan Muthukrishnan, who has been my mentor ever since. Getting certified after the four-month course with a Master Diploma in Training and Development, I decided to put in my papers as I had now found my path to do what I truly loved and give it my best."  That unique drop in the ocean  With an ocean of trainers in the market, finding a niche was Ramya's biggest challenge. After a couple of quiet months and no paycheque coming into the bank, her family subtly dropped hints for her to get back to a regular job. But Ramya's belief in herself and her positive outlook helped her remain steadfast with her decision. The other amusing challenge was that people didn't take her seriously as she looked rather young to train the corporate management cadre.    "I didn't want to go back to an IT career, so I gathered up my courage and offered a public workshop in Chennai on, 'Powerful presentations made easy'. To my surprise, the response was great and the visibility I received after that paved the way towards what I am now. Thanks to my presence on social media (Facebook page - /trainingsbyramya), many companies approached me for corporate projects. And now I ensure that I mention that I am a mother of a little one, so they know I am older than I look!"  Spurring on  Finding her niche, Ramya decided to start her own training company, Spur One Solutions in 2017, offering unique training programs to corporates and educational institutions. The workshops range from Business Communication to Executive Leadership and Design Thinking. "Apart from the corporate workshops, I conduct a public workshop pan-India on Excepionalism (Going by the theory of - Being one in a million and not one among a million), where I train individuals on being different and unique from the ordinary. Within the session I guide the participants with tools to prepare a complete plan for their lifetime to achieve their biggest dream and live their passion without fear. It gives more clarity to the lives of the participants, which is key to achieving what they want and make their life worth living." To expand her connections, Ramya joined Business Network International. "The network I built in BNI gave me great visibility and opportunity to get connected with many quality entrepreneurs."  Workdays are fun  Ramya's training days vary from eight to 20 every month. "My workday, which is actually my fun day, starts with setting up things for my family in the morning and rushing to do what I love -- training participants -- brainstorming, lecturing, playing relevant games to drive across the message to participants, and facilitating creative discussions to ensure they walk out as transformed individuals either emotionally or cognitively." Other days she's busy meeting clients, preparing modules, or watching videos of great trainers to update herself. "I keep aside at least seven days a month for family and make sure I give quality time to my husband and my four-year-old daughter. My family, especially my husband and mom, have been my two pillars of support."     Looking ahead  "I plan to take Exceptionalism around the world to help as many people to truly bring out the best in them and live their lives with a purpose and follow their passion. Thanks to all the learning and training that I've attended in the course of becoming an Exceptionalism Coach, I myself am a transformed person." "'Believe and you're already half-way there,' said Theodore Roosevelt but I say, 'Believe that you can do it, and you're 90% there; 10% is only the effort that you put in and that automatically falls into place."

As per the baseline ranking, Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh is ranked highest with score of 48.13 per cent while Mewat in Haryana tails at the end with 26.02 per cent. Among others, Asifabad (Telangana), Singrauli (Madhya Pradesh), Kiphire (Nagaland), Shrawasti, Siddarthnagar and Balrampur (Uttar Pradesh), Namsai (Arunachal Pradesh), Sukma (Chattisgarh) are ranked at bottom of the list.  While on top of the list among others include Rajnandgaon (Chhattisgarh), Osmanabad (Maharashtra), Cuddapah (Andhra Pradesh), Ramanathapuram (Tamil Nadu), Udham Singh Nagar (Uttarakhand), Mahasamund (Chhattisgarh), Khammam (Telangana), Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). From April 1, these 101 districts will start entering data and the real-time data collection and monitoring will be open for public viewing. From May onwards, they will be ranked based on progress made (delta ranking) on a real-time basis. NITI Aayog and the Andhra Pradesh government have created a dashboard for monitoring the real-time progress of the districts. The 49 indicators on 81 data points will cover five development areas - health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development and basic infrastructure. While announcing the launch of ranking for the "Aspirational Districts', NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said: "India cannot grow at a high rate on a long run until these districts catch up, whatever high are the GDP number, it has no meaning until the benefit of growth percolates down to very basic level." The ranking of districts comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 'Transformation of Aspirational Districts' in January with an aim to quickly and effectively transform some of the most underdeveloped districts in the country. This will converge the central and state schemes, collaborate central, state and district collectors to strengthen these districts by identifying the low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement, measure progress and then rank the district by getting the data on a real-time basis. All the states - except West Bengal and Kerala - are on board in this ranking initiative; however, these states are expected to join soon, Kant said. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 29 Mar, 11.31 am4 days ago

[Report copy here] | Mohammed Nalapad, son of MLA NA Harris, has surrendered in the case of assaulting Vidvat at UB City in Bengaluru. The current documents available from the Mallya Hospital, where Vidvat is being treated might prove to be a disadvantage for Nalapad. The medical report of Vidvat from the Mallya Hospital states that he was conscious, alert and not under the influence of alcohol.    This report becomes important as earlier, a counter complaint against Vidvat was filed by one Arun Kumar with the Cubbon Park police sating that, he had gone to Farzi Cafe at UB City for dinner along with friends, and under the influence of alcohol, started a fight with Nalapad and friends, and assaulted them. Arun in his complaint, said, "We request you to examine Vidvat, who is being treated in the ICU section of the hospital and give us a report of his condition (whether he was under the influence of alcohol)."   Complaint copy:     Thus, with the report stating that Vidvat was not under the influence of alcohol, the case has become stronger against Nalapad. Vidvat is badly injured, and Nalapad has, at last, surrendered 36 hours after the incident. Currently, his lawyer is trying to get Nalapad out on bail. The medical report can be a strong source, which can be used by Vidvat in proving his case.

We can protect our skin from the harmful UV rays by putting together some simple natural ingredients that are available in every household! Austin, Head - Research and Development, Cholayil Private Limited and Omkar Kulkarni, Head - Research and Development, Netsurf Network share some important Ayurvedic tips for tackling skin issues in summer.    * Skin hydration is the key: Ayurveda mentions that 'Snigdhata' (meaning internal hydration) of the body is the key to fight multiple skin related issues. One should schedule water drinking reminders across the day. Carry a water bottle to avoid thirsty outings and travels. Replace aerated drinks, tea and coffee with coconut water, thandai, kokum sharbat, lemon juice, buttermilk, khas drink, sugarcane juice, etc.  * Mind the heat: According to Ayurveda, the basic reason behind blood impurification and skin disorders is sudden temperature changes. Avoid stepping out directly from Air conditioned atmosphere into harsh sun and vice-versa.    * Try ayurvedic DIY (Do it Yourself) face mask: Use multani mitti face mask in combination with milk for dry skin, honey for oily skin & water for normal skin. This will improve the natural glow of the skin. One can also try a homemade face pack with smash boiled potatoes with 2 Tbsp of lemon juice to lighten the skin color and to give it a natural glow. * Spice up your life: Cinnamon has great anti-microbial properties. Powder it and mix with 1 tablespoon of honey and sugar granules. Use this mixture as a natural scrub to remove the dead skin from the face. * Coat skin with layers of Aloevera and cucumber: Skin toners are very important for people with oily or acne-prone skin as it cleanse the skin and closes the pores by tightening the cell gaps. Preparing a toner depending on your skin type will have a great effect. Mix Apple Cider Vinegar and water in 1:1 ratio and add half cup of green tea and cucumber juice and Aloe Vera gel. Shake it well and then apply it on the skin to soothe and to repair the skin. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 10 Apr, 9.40 pm5 days agoa week ago2 weeks ago3 weeks ago7 days ago

In a similar incident from Hyderabad, a priest carried a Dalit man into a temple on his shoulders and hugged him as part of a 3000-year-old tradition. CS Rangarajan of Chilkur Balaji Temple carried Aditya Parasri into the sanctum sanctorum as he sent a strong message against discrimination.      The ritual called Muni Vahana Seva is a re-enactment of a 2700-year-old incident and is aimed at propagating equality among all sections of society and to stop oppression of Dalits.  Meanwhile Parasri said that he has faced discrimination and was even allowed entry in temples because he is Dalit, but hopes that gestures like this can bring positive change in the mindset.

The currency in circulation in India as on 6 April.Why is it important? Several states including Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and poll-bound Karnataka complained of cash shortage in ATMs on Tuesday, reminiscent of the government's demonetisation move in November 2016. Though the cash in circulation has surpassed pre-demonetisation levels, the ratio of cash-in-circulation to GDP (gross domestic product) has declined to 10.7% now from 11.6% before demonetisation.Tell me more: The government has said that the current cash crunch problem is temporary and that it has stepped up the printing of Rs500 currency notes by five times. As much as Rs70,000-75,000 worth of notes will be printed in a month. Rs5,320 croreWhat is it? The total equity and debt infusion by Vedanta Ltd into Electrosteel Steels, according to its resolution plan for the latter, which was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday.Why is it important? This is the first of the 12 large stressed assets, which was identified by the Reserve Bank of India last June for insolvency resolution, to be resolved. With Electrosteel owing more than Rs13,395 crore, lenders have taken a 55% haircut (amount a lender has to forego to settle a loan). This is lower than initial estimation. Tell me more: Edelweiss, in a research report, says banks are likely to take 52% haircuts in the top 12 loan default accounts, as compared to earlier estimate of 60%. 20,000What is it? The number of plastic bottles human beings produce every second.Why is it important? Though polyethylene terephthalate (PET) that is commonly used to make millions of plastic bottles is highly recyclable, efforts to recycle them are unable to keep pace with production. A group of scientists in Britain and the United States say they have engineered an enzyme that can digest PET, though it is too early to say that this can be a solution to pollution caused by plastic.Tell me more: Between 1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes of plastics enter oceans from rivers every year, and top 20 polluting rivers account for 67% of the total, according to a 2017 study published in Nature magazine. Rs100 What is it? The amount of compensation per hour payable to consumers for unscheduled power cuts in Delhi. Why is it important? This move will improve customer service as all complaints will be timed and compensation have to paid for every hour of non-resolution. It will also force power distribution companies to better forecast demand and purchase power to meet the demand. Compensation of Rs50 is payable for power cuts in the first two hours in a day, and then Rs100 per hour after that. Tell me more: Maharashtra has the lowest number of times (1.22) of power cuts in March 2018, and Jharkhand has the highest at 55.61 times, as per power ministry data for 20 states. Data for Delhi was not available. 7.9 million What is it? The number of students enrolled in science at higher secondary level in 2015-16 academic year, as compared to 6.2 million in previous year, as per data from Unified District Information System on Education (U-DISE). Why is it important? This represents nearly 3 percentage point increase in enrollment in science subjects, and it reverses the trend in 2014-15 when enrollment in sciences dipped by 2 percentage point. The increase could indicate more students preferring science or increase in high scoring students leading to more enrollment in sciences. Tell me more: Enrollment in higher secondary education has also increased to 23.2 million in 2015-16, as compared to 19.9 million in 2014-15. howindialives.com is a search engine for public data.Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 18 Apr, 12.00 pm2 weeks agoa week ago4 days ago3 days agoa week ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/business+world-epaper-bizworld/tax+free+gratuity+ceiling+raised+to+rs+20+lakh-newsid-84668054| News Tax-free gratuity ceiling raised to Rs 20 lakh |  The government today notified doubling of the limit of tax-free gratuity to Rs 20 lakh in private sector. The notification follows changes in the Payment of Gratuity Act which had empowered the government to fix the ceiling of the retirement benefit through an executive order. The amendment bill approved by Parliament earlier in the month had also empowered the government to fix the period of maternity leave. Accordingly, the central government has fixed the total period of maternity leave in the case of a female employee to 26 weeks. After implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission, the ceiling of tax-free gratuity amount for the central government employees was increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The unions have been demanding for inclusion of the change in the Payment of Gratuity Act.  So far, formal sector workers with five or more years of service are eligible for Rs 10 lakh tax-free gratuity after leaving job or at time of superannuation. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, was enacted to provide for gratuity payment to employees engaged in factories, mines, oilfields, plantations, ports, railway companies, shops or other establishments. The law is applicable to employees, who have completed at least five years of continuous service in an establishment that has 10 or more persons.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/india+press+agency-epaper-indpres/smriti+irani+april+fooled+on+april+3-newsid-84934126| Home Smriti irani april-fooled on april 3! |  Aditya Aamir  Information & Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani proposes and the PMO disposes! But not to her liking. Late on April 2, Irani directed that journalists who "create and publish fake news" will face six months' suspension for the first violation; one year for a second and will be permanently iced after the third. On April 3, the PMO held that the PIB and NBA are supreme and that the "punishment regime' suggested by Irani stands discredited, her order withdrawn. News is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself strode into the PMO to axe Ms Irani's diktat. The question then is: Did Smriti Irani takes a unilateral decision? Or, did the PM realize it better than her that PIB accreditation allows journalists only to cover government functions and entry into government buildings? A journalist needs no government accreditation to cover news on the ground; he/she is a free-bird.  Ms Irani had delivered her diktat on April 2, 2018. If it was April 1, everyone would have taken it as an attempt to 'April Fool' journalists and she would have been in the news for creating 'Fake News'. Now, she is in the news for being fooled the day after April Fool Day! That said, if 'Fake News' sat in front of Smriti Irani and told her its story she wouldn't know it from Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. Ms Irani is a byproduct of Bollywood, that ultimate dream factory, India's soft-power, which weaves fantasies and puts actors in the role of journalists knowing zilch about journalism, real journalism. With few exceptions, filmy-journalists have portrayed journalists in hack-roles, the butt of ire and derision. Some of Smriti Irani's directions and orders in recent months, ever since she was reinstated by PM Narendra Modi in his cabinet, has done 'real' damage to journalist morale in Doordarshan, cutting to the quick the autonomous Prasar Bharati. Smriti Irani has no idea the effect her one thoughtless diktat can have on the journalist-fraternity. There is no two ways that this latest one was out and out an attempt to crack down on journalists. It was an unalloyed threat to self-censor or else. Sure, there are 'fake journalists' with PIB accreditation; journalists who haven't written or even concocted a news story in two decades and more but get government accreditation only because they have links to a unheard of publishing house in some remote location which purportedly brings out a 'newspaper/magazine' that nobody has read or heard about. That is another story and not fake! Anyway, the real story on April 3 morning was that Smriti Irani had amended the 'Guidelines for Accreditation of Journalists' with the ostensible reason that there were rising instances of fake news across media, in newspapers and on TV channels. In her wisdom, Irani left websites and social media platforms - Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp - out of the 'Wake'. That was good news for the likes of Cambridge Analytica. Amended, the Irani-guidelines said that 'fake news" in print media would be referred to the Press Council of India (PCI) and those in electronic media would be sent to the News Broadcasters' Association (NBA) for action taken. That PCI and NBA would decide in 15 days' time if a piece of news was fake or not. And for those 15 days the journalist who wrote or propagated the news item would sit on his rump and play Tweedledum and Tweedledee. True, Press Information Bureau (PIB) accreditation entitles journalists to several benefits, including access to government buildings and official functions. On April 1, Smriti Irani and several of her cabinet colleagues tweeted an article from a website, which claimed to have busted four major fake news stories in a week. The real news was that the I&B ministry was turning into a fact-checking outfit and that was not fake news! But while declaring war on journalists Irani left unclear what news qualified for 'Fake News', in other words, without any fake inputs from the government. What was the definition and nature of 'fake news' in the government's eyes? There was nothing on that in Smriti Irani's statement. The fact of the matter is a journalist is accredited to PIB after he/she has completed five years of full-time journalism. Freelance journalists need to have 15 years of the same. Foreign journalists should have five years and a valid work visa to report news from India. Smriti Irani has her office in the same building which has the PIB office and journalists are a ubiquitous presence in Shastri Bhavan. In 70 years, nobody who graced the chair she holds had attempted to 'gherao' journalists the way this minister did. In this year of the "unprecedented", honest journalists - and there are thousands of them in the country who work without PIB accreditation - should tell Smriti Irani to take a hike, to Bollywood! Ms Irani looked like she has agenda. And just because PM Modi has rescinded her order doesn't mean she will sit quiet. The mass of journalists should boycott every Smriti Irani presser/meet. At the same time scrutinize every one of her actions and non-actions and come to definite conclusions backed with facts and figures to expose her agenda. Let Smriti Irani be the focus of news. Uncover Irani's motives behind every one of her actions, such as this one. The big fact is fake news is the preserve of politicians and political parties. They are the ones who concoct news and spread it by whatever means to 'far and wide'. (IPA Service)  Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 03 Apr, 9.04 am2 weeks agoa week ago2 weeks ago9 hrs ago7 days ago

After its Rs 44 special plan, Rs 8 and Rs 19 packs and unlimited voice and data calls to any network, it has now launched the all-new plan offering free voice and 1GB data for 90 days.  This means you will get 90GB data and unlimited calls at Rs 429 for three months. The free calls include local and STD. It also means Rs 143 per month for unlimited calls and 1GB data per day.  The plan is available to all, the exception being the Kerala circle. Recently, BSNL launched new plan to take on similar deals on Airtel and Jio, by offering unlimited data and calls at Rs 298  . It brings unlimited voice calls for both local and STD across any network. And, the plan also includes unlimited data. There is limit on data, which means you can access 1GB data per day and post that the speed will be reduced to 80kbps. It will be valid for 56 days.  Besides, the new plans include a Rs 19 offer that brings on-net voice calls at 15 paise/minute and off-net voice calls at 35 paise/minute. This plan comes with a validity of 90 days. Another plan offering the same benefits is priced at Rs 8, but the validity is just 30 days. Interestingly, both plans are launched pan-India. So, they are applicable to all BSNL users across the country. The catch is they are applicable only for prepaid subscribers. Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 06 Sep, 2.11 am

However, none of the mosques have been destroyed in such acts of vandalism.  Notably, Jammu and Kashmir government on Thursday while replying to the question of BJP MLA in state parliament said that in the last two decades of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, nearly 208 Hindu temples have been destroyed in various acts of vandalism. "Of the 438 temples in the Valley, 208 had been damaged over the years," it said. The government further said, "A total of 63 hectares of land were under the 436 temples in Kashmir. There was no case of encroachment on these lands so far." "In south Kashmir Kulgam district nearly 85% of the 754 structures have been damaged," government added.  Notably, Srinagar ranks first with 57 temples being destroyed with Anantnag, coming close to second having 56 temples being destroyed by militants. Interestingly, the authorities have kept shut on the cause of such destruction and have been cautious in not blaming the entire episode of vandalism on the militants. On the other hand, Sanjay Tickoo of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a body of Kashmiri Pandits disputed the government figures, claimed that around 550 temples were damaged and 50,000 canals have been encroached upon.

Ashish Vidyarthi? | At least two videos on YouTube showed actor Ashish Vidyarthi as the father of Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love Story's wink sensation Priya Varrier. But is it true? Absolutely not. Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago

Reservation before Independence!      Reservation was actually a blessing in disguise from the British Raj.

The depressed classes were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from special constituencies in which voters belonging to the depressed classes only could vote. This was protested by Mahatma Gandhiji and he went on a hunger strike. It is then various prominent leaders like Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had an agreement with Gandhiji referred as Poona Pact.

Despite of protests, the judgement was upheld by the supreme court but a 'cream layer' was introduced in 'OBCs' that were excluded of reservation.

Due to this more and more caste has been doing their best to be included in the reservation quota. Despite many efforts the protest have been increasing more and more by many castes to include them in the quota. Be it the gujjar protests or the recent Jat protests in Hariyana. Hope the government do the best and resolve the issue of reservation. The reservation on the basis of economic state instead of caste can also be a great option since it will actually help to uplift the unprivileged. What is your stand on this?

In fact, the Compass now even outsells the XUV500 - a best-seller for years. Such has been the appeal of the Compass that Jeep is now gearing up to launch more affordable SUVs in India. According to the Detroit Free Press, the Renegade is the next big launch for the Indian market from Jeep. The Renegade will be a butch SUV that offers a more rugged alternative to the likes of the Hyundai Creta and Maruti Suzuki S-Cross, both of which are more of crossovers than SUVs. Like the Compass, Jeep India will be looking at heavy localization for the Renegade as well. The SUV is expected to borrow the 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engine from the Compass, but in a lower state of tune. Jeep may use the 140 Bhp and 210 Nm state of tune on the Renegade, which is the same tune that is offered on the Abarth range of Fiat cars such as the Punto, Avventura and Urban Cross. The diesel engine is expected to be the 1.6-litre Fiat Multijet unit that the company used to supply Maruti. This engine makes 120 Bhp and 320 Nm.  Both engines could use 6-speed manual gearboxes as standard. Automatic gearboxes are also likely to be offered considering the fact that the Indian SUV market now demands it, even in affordable segments. The Renegade will be front wheel driven on most variants while Jeep is also expected to offer a fully loaded, Trailhawk variant to differentiate this SUV from the many crossovers that are on sale in India. More details on Jeep's strategy will be known as the launch timeframe for the Renegade approaches.    For now, it appears that the Renegade could make it to India sometime next year considering that the Compass will be a couple of years old by then. As is the case with the Compass, the Fiat factory at Ranjangaon could become an export hub for the Renegade as well. Jeep is able to deliver high quality vehicles for demanding export markets, as evidenced by the Compass's exports, which now total over 7,000 units. A similar strategy with the Renegade could help Jeep garner high profits as selling in export markets is likely to make the project viable.

Listed are 10 superstars of the B-Town film industry and their weight reduction regime to help you kick the fat and shed the extra kilos from your body.  1. Sonakshi Sinha  Sonakshi Sinha faced much backlash for her weight when she made her debut with ' Dabangg'. This superstar once weighed 94 kg and she took a challenge and reduced 30 kg which was not an easy for her. She gained that much weight due to lack of exercise, excess intake of junk foods, but during her whole weight loss journey, she controlled her craving for junk foods and took balanced diet.  2. Sonam Kapoor     'Miss Style Icon' of Bollywood, Sonam Kapoor, who is known for her fashion seance rather than her acting skills, was around 86 kg before she signed her first film, "Saawariya". Her weight gain was due to unhealthy diet she used to have. She reduced 35 kilos to get that subtle yet sensuous look in her film. Sonam is very strict with her diet. She follows a low-carb and high-protein diet which is divided into five small meals. She munches on dry fruits and drinks milkshakes if she feels her hunger rising.  3. Parineeti Chopra      Parineeti, made bollywood debut with"Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl" in 2011 but got reorganization with romantic drama "Ishaqzaade" in 2012. Parineeti herself admitted in media that she was 86 kg before joining the Bollywood. Like all other actress of Bollywood, she also followed a strict diet plan, regular exercise, meditation, yoga session and due to all this hard work, she shed her extra weight and finally achieved success on her journey of Fat to Fit.  4. Arjun Kapoor     Dis you believe our heartthrob Arjun Kapoor wasn't this fit and fab in his teens. Arjun weighed over 170 kilos before Bollywood's fittest celeb Salman Khan took him under his wings and the '2 States' star lost 68 kilos for that fit 'n' fab body. His diet is very rich in protein. He consumes a lot of egg whites, boiled or grilled chicken and fish. He likes his chapatis made with pearl millet. He is a meat lover. He eats pineapple and strawberries and prefers protein shakes.  5. Zareen Khan     Hot and Bold Bollywood actress Zareen Khan was criticised for her weight gain. The actress, who looks fit and fab now, used to be a chubby girl in her teens and pre-teens. At one point of time Zareen weighed 100 kilos! But when she decided to being a model she shed those extra kilos. And within a year, with right exercise and diet, she lost 43 kilograms. To lose weight, Zareen followed a high protein diet which includes a lot of fruits and vegetable. Other than this, she is obsessed with drinking a lot of water for a good detox.   6. Jackky Bhagnani     'Youngistaan' actor Jackky Bhagnani weighed 130 kilos before becoming an actor. He lost over 80 kgs with rigorous exercises and a strict diet plan which he followed for over two years.  7. Bhumi Pednekar     The "Dum Laga Ke Haisha" actress already weighed 72 kgs, when she got an offer for this movie. And for this, she had to put even more weight and weighed around 89 kgs at the time she made her debut. However, soon after the film, the actress managed to drop all the extra fat and looks super-fit now! Unlike other celebrities, she did not restrict herself from enjoying the food. All she did was to switch the unhealthy ones with healthy choices. She gave up on refined sugar, carbs and alcohol. Her mother made a diet chart for her which included simple homestyle food.  8. Alia Bhatt     The young star of Bollywood who made her debut as a lead actress in the movie, "Student of the Year", was not always as fit as she looks now. She almost lost 16 kg of weight in 3 months. She avoids junk food and rather prefers to have a vegetable rich diet.  9. Tanmay Bhatt     Tanmay Bhatt has made us laugh harder than we could handle. He lost 109 kgs by following Keto diet. The diet endorses increased intake of healthy fats along with some proteins. It is a low carb diet. It might sound weird but this actually works.  10. RJ Malishka     RJ Malishka who showed her other talents on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa understood the importance of being fit on the dance-based reality show. She lost heaps of weight by working hard and following healthy eating habits. Her diet is more raw and paleo in nature.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+quint-epaper-quint/five+times+the+internet+broke+the+mahabharata-newsid-85989239?mode=pw| Home Dear Tripura CM, You Are Right. The Internet Broke the Mahabharata | Too caught up to read the story? Listen to it instead.Thank you Biplab Kumar Deb. India's biggest technological breakthrough can finally be rightfully reclaimed. We invented the internet - the reason all of you can watch yoga videos on Youtube (the yoga reference put in for obvious reasons - if you must rub in civilisational greatness, you may as well go the whole hog).Anyway, coming back to the Tripura CM - he said that internet and satellite communication was the reason Sanjaya could give such a vivid account of the battle of Kurukshetra to King Dhritarashtra. There is no reason to disbelieve him - and there is no evidence to suggest the contrary. In fact, I do believe the honourable minister in all humility has grossly understated the facts. The internet, not Lord Krishna, played a starring role in moving things along in the Mahabharata. Here are a few things that he missed out on, which I will be glad to fill you in on.Family Whatsapp Group Troubles Began in 8th Century BCThe root of all conflict in the Mahabharata can be traced back to a sunny afternoon in the 8th century BC when young Yudhishthira decided to create a family WhatsApp group. Believing that a WhatsApp group can only accommodate a maximum of 100 people, the young lad left out a few of his cousins. Not too many - just 100 of them. It was hardly his fault that there were 100 Kauravas to begin with.Fortunately, the resident geek Vidura intervened and gently pointed out that a WhatsApp group can now go up to 256. Being unnaturally scrupulous, Yudhishthira added all of his cousins, but naturally remained group administrator. This inflamed Duryodhana but try as he might, he couldn't wrest control of the group. Adding further fuel to the fire were the incessant core training videos that Bhima uploaded on the group - given Duryodhana's suspect core, it was clear who was being targeted. Duryodhana exited the group, swearing one day to take it over. He could have easily set up his own group, but he was petty that way.'Complicated' FB Relationship Statuses & 'Shakuni Analytica'Then the contentious issue of WiFi. Bhishma, the passive aggressive laissez faire patriarch, decreed that the router to happiness could only be one. With 100 Kauravas and 5 Pandavas, you can imagine who ended up hogging the internet. This particularly displeased the pretty boys Nakul and Sahadev who had built quite a following on Instagram by posting pouting selfies.They also occasionally put up guess-who posts which had all of Hastinapur's girls blushing and sighing. But now their upload time took forever and their following had plateaued. In all of this, one thing was clear - Hastinapur quite clearly didn't have the bandwidth to deal with two sets of rulers.And then Draupadi. It can finally be told what the final catalyst in the feud was. Draupadi in her relationship status on Facebook wrote in all truthfulness, 'It is complicated'. Thirty seconds later, Duryodhana sent her a knowing 'wink emoticon' on Messenger. A furious Draupadi blocked him - and the rest, as they say, is a BR Chopra soap.Finally, however, the entire Pandava clan exited Facebook after they realised their data is being sold to 'Shakuni Analytica' - a shady market research firm on the payroll of Duryodhana to rig the popular mood in Hastinapur.Final Nail in Mahabharata's Coffin? Fake NewsHowever, their exit from Facebook came a little too late, after Bhima made the tragic error of checking in to Facebook in the 13th year of their exile in Virata. This led to their discovery, and Duryodhana reneging on his promise to restore the kingdom to them. In retrospect, marking themselves 'safe' after Lakshagraha burnt down wasn't the smartest move either. The perils of internet addiction - we know it too well, having invented it.And finally, the last blow that the internet struck the Mahabharata: the fake news algorithms played fast and loose with the happenings on the battleground in Kurukshetra. This was called the 'Ashwatthama effect', and played a crucial part in swinging things the Pandava way. Not to mention, the many motivational forwards Lord Krishna sent Arjuna on doing his duty - motivational memes, GIFs and even a TEDx video on 'Doing your Dharma'.The above is only a very short gist of the many ways the Mahabharata was affected by the internet. It is indeed shameful that many centuries later, the Western world should take credit for what is one of our most stupendous discoveries. More power to Biplab Kumar Deb. Let false notions of Western innovation and discovery crumble like Lenin statues in Tripura.The Caravan this week published a series of stories on the death of CBI special judge BH Loya in December 2014. Journalist Niranjan Takle has spoken extensively to the family of Judge Loya, who, before he died, was presiding over the high-profile Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter killing case - in which a prime accused was BJP President Amit Shah. Shah was discharged by the judge who succeeded Judge Loya.The revelations made by Judge Loya's sisters, father and others form the basis of the stories. These, along with Takle's own investigation, who spoke to officials in Nagpur who dealt with Loya's body after he was found dead, raise several grave questions.1. Why was Judge JT Utpat, Judge Loya's predecessor in hearing the case, transferred from hearing the case despite a 2012 Supreme Court order specifying that the same judge should hear the matter from start to finish?2. Were Bombay High Court Chief Justice Mohit Shah or the principal accused Amit Shah aware of any alleged inducements offered to Judge Loya to ensure a favourable judgment in the case?3. Does Justice Mohit Shah deny the allegation by Judge Loya's sister Anuradha Biyani, that he himself made an offer of Rs 100 crore in return for a favourable judgment?[Takle had received no response from Justice Shah at the time of publication of the article mentioning this allegation]4. Who made the arrangements for Judge Loya's transportation to Dande Hospital on the night of his death, and why was this not in a vehicle from the government guest house or an ambulance?5. Do Dande Hospital and/or Meditrina Hospital have records indicating what medication was provided to Judge Loya while in their care, and who was with him at the time?6. What was the time of Judge Loya's death according to the records of Meditrina Hospital and when do call records show this was intimated to Judge Loya's family? Did the death occur at 6:15 am or before 5 am on 1 December 2014, or did it in fact occur before midnight?[Judge Loya's family says they received calls informing them of his death from 5 am in the morning onwards, but the post-mortem report specifies the time of death as 6:15 am, and other sources informed Takle that Judge Loya passed away before midnight]The Quint has not conducted an independent corroboration of the claims made in the articles, and therefore does not affirm the truth of such claims. These include alleged discrepancies between the post-mortem report and the condition of Judge Loya's body and clothes, as well as allegations that the then Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court offered monetary inducements to Judge Loya to give a favourable judgment.Nonetheless, the gravity of these claims (several of which are made on video here), which strike at the very heart of the judicial system if true, necessitates that they be investigated properly at the very least.7. In what circumstances can a person die of "coronary artery insufficiency"? Is it possible for a person in good physical health without any cardiac history or other markers of this condition, experience "coronary artery insufficiency" and lose their life?[Judge Loya's sister, a doctor, claims that Judge Loya had no medical history consistent with the condition, and that this raised doubts as to whether this could be the cause of death]8. Why was a post-mortem report ordered into Judge Loya's death when no panchnama or FIR was filed terming it a suspicious death, and why was Judge Loya's family not informed about the performance of a post-mortem? Alternatively, were any reasons for performance of post-mortem report recorded, where were these recorded and who recorded them?9. Who signed the post-mortem report pages as "maiyatacha chulatbhau" (ie paternal cousin brother of the deceased) when no relation of Judge Loya was present in Nagpur? Does the countersignatory, the senior police inspector of Sadar police station, recollect who this was?10. What was Ishwar Baheti's relationship with the deceased and on what basis was he coordinating the funeral arrangements for Judge Loya, including contacting the family? Why was Judge Loya's phone returned to the family by Mr Baheti rather than the police? Alternatively, did the police ask Mr Baheti to return the phone to Judge Loya's family?11. Does Judge Loya's family still have the allegedly bloodstained shirt worn by Judge Loya at the time of death which the post-mortem report claims was dry?12. Is it true that the CBI was only given 15 minutes to argue against the discharge of Amit Shah in subsequent hearings of the case before Judge Loya's successor in hearing the case, Judge Gosavi, as against three days for the defence lawyers?13. Who made the decision to announce MS Dhoni's retirement from test cricket on 30 December 2014? Was this decided by the player or the BCCI and did any external source suggest the specific date?[Judge Loya's sister alleges that Judge Loya was informed that if he would deliver the judgment in the case before 30 December 2014, it would not be under focus because another news story would dominate the headlines and distract focus from the judgment](Breathe In, Breathe Out: Are you finding it tough to breathe polluted air?

After Anajanmurthy's aides burnt tyres and shouted slogans against Rahul Gandhi on the highway near Nelmangala, supporters of party leader Ravikumar have vandalised the party office in Mandya district. Supporters of some other disgruntled ticket aspirants damaged party's offices in Chikmaglur, Bengaluru and Bellary. Another rebuffed party leader Brajesh Kalappa expressed displeasure on Facebook.Stay tuned for LIVE updates:  Apr 16, 2018 4:56 pm (IST)  By not giving tickets to Christians or Muslims, the BJP seems to be repeating its Uttar Pradesh strategy. Like UP, Karnataka has a numerically-significant Muslim population, but the BJP has not deemed it fit to name a single candidate from the community so far. The party had faced flak in UP too, but defended its stance, by saying that it must look at winnability. "I want to make an appeal to all Muslim brothers and sisters that they should join us. We will not allow hatred to prosper," Rajnath Singh had said.   Apr 16, 2018 4:38 pm (IST) Another Reddy clan member Sanna Fakerappa has also got a ticket. The BJP has not named any Christian or Muslim as a candidate so far.   Apr 16, 2018 4:37 pm (IST) Earlier, there was speculation that Somashekar may not get a ticket as BJP wants to stay away from those with a tainted past. Somashekar had placed all his trust in the statement of State BJP president BS Yeddyurappa during his Parivartan Yatra asking people to ensure his victory with a huge margin. He had already undertaken rigorous door-to-door campaign in the city.  Apr 16, 2018 4:33 pm (IST) Somashekar Reddy, the elder brother of mining baron G Janardhan Reddy, faces the charge of trying to bribe a Judge of a Special CBI Court to get bail for Janardhan Reddy. Somashekar, it may be mentioned here, won from the Ballari (city) constituency in the 2008 elections with a slender margin of 1,022 votes against Congress candidate Anil Lad. He did not contest the 2013 elections.  Apr 16, 2018 4:31 pm (IST) The second BJP list has an unmissable Yeddyurappa stamp, with several of his loyalists getting tickets. There are also several with tainted pasts in the BJP list. Among those is elder Reddy brother, G Somashekar Reddy, who will contest from Bellary city. Another tainted member is Katta Subramanya Naidu who was sent to jail after he and son were caught red handed by Lokayukta. He will contest from Shivajinagar. Krishnaiah Shetty who went to jail with BSY in Denotification scam has got a ticket from Malur. MP Renukacharya of sleaze gate past has got a ticket from Honnali.  Apr 16, 2018 4:24 pm (IST) The BJP, however, has still not announced who will face off against CM Siddaramaiah in Chamundeshwari or his son in Varuna constituency. The BJP had earlier announced candidates for 72 seats and a final list is still awaited.   Apr 16, 2018 4:20 pm (IST) BJP releases second list of 82 candidates for Karnataka Assembly polls, a day after Congress released its list of 218 candidates.  Apr 16, 2018 2:30 pm (IST) The dissident Congress workers in Karntaka's Mandya, Chikmaglur, Bengaluru and Bellary vandalised Congress offices for denying ticket to Ravikumar. Congress has given ticket to sitting MLA, actor Ambarish from Mandya. Ravikumar, who was also ticket aspirant, did not get the ticket. The supporters of Ravikumar went on street in Mandya condemning the move. They attacked Congress office and smashed the chairs and doors. They demanded to change the list and give ticket to Ravikumar from Mandya.  Apr 16, 2018 2:27 pm (IST)  Apr 16, 2018 1:55 pm (IST) Welcoming Owaisi's support, JDS' Kumaraswamy said, "Owaisi gave a befitting replying to Congress leaders who have been making allegations against JDS." The JDS state chief was mentioning Owaisi's statement where he said that both Congress and BJP have failed and have nothing to offer to Karnataka. Kumaraswamy further said, "It is possible that Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, who met us last week, may have persuaded Owaisi to support us."​  Apr 16, 2018 1:27 pm (IST) Congress leader and ex MLA, Prasannakumar, likely to join JDS. He is from Bengaluru city. KPCC vice president V R Sudarshan is upset over not getting party ticket from Kolar. He may join BJP.  Apr 16, 2018 1:26 pm (IST) A few MLAs, who did not get ticket, are meeting Mallikarjun Kharge. The former railways minister is reportedly upset that Siddaramaiah has got lion's share. Meanwhile, power minister D K Shivakumar says JDS and BJP have an agreement to defeat Siddaramaiah in Chamundeshwari and the pact was sealed three months ago.  Apr 16, 2018 1:22 pm (IST) The income tax department raided the residence of Congress MLA B Shivanna at the behest of Election Commission. Income tax officials said that since EC does not have powers to enter candidates' homes, the Commisson alerted IT that considerable cash was stashed at Shivanna's home. The IT officials then raided Shivanna's home at 5.30 am. They completed the raid at 9.30 am, but did not recover anything.  Apr 16, 2018 12:01 pm (IST) In the last three months, the Karnataka government was asked to spend as much as Rs 56 crore to glorify the achievements of chief minister Siddaramaiah ahead of state assembly elections. An RTI reply shows that the government used hoardings of its Department of Information and Publicity and other billboards on buses and auto-rickshaws, metro rail pillars, bus shelters of the BBMP, LED mobile vans and LED hoardings. Besides, video ads put out on social media, websites and TV channels are accounted for separately.  Apr 16, 2018 11:54 am (IST)  Apr 16, 2018 11:35 am (IST) MIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi said that he spoke to JD(S) chief H D Kumaraswamy and has decided that he will support former PM HD Deve Gowda's party. "It is in the interest of Karnataka and the nation that he (Kumaraswamy) becomes the CM. Congress is not powerful enough to stop BJP," he said. According to JDS sources, Owaisi had even approached Deve Gowda earlier for seat sharing arrangements, which was turned down by the former Prime Minister.  Apr 16, 2018 11:19 am (IST) Contrary to expectations, Siddaramaiah has only kept one seat for himself. There were rumors that he wanted to play it safe and contest from two seats. The Karnataka CM will now contest from only Chamundeshwari Assembly seat  People of north Karnataka had requested me to contest from Badami. I am grateful for their love & affection, but I have decided to contest only from ChamundeshwariCongratulations to candidates nominated to contest the Elections on a Congress ticket.Let us bring Congress back!— Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) April 16, 2018   Apr 16, 2018 11:05 am (IST) Congress ticket aspirant Anajanmurthy's followers stage a protest near Nelmangala after he was denied ticket. The protesters burn tyres on the highway. Meanwhile, another aspirant, Kalappa, has retweeted a post which says he should have been given ticket. The is believed to be upset with the Congress leadership.  Apr 16, 2018 10:21 am (IST)  Apr 16, 2018 10:00 am (IST) With an eye on Karnataka Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a five-day visit to Sweden and United Kindgom, will pay tributes at the statue of 12th-century Lingayat philosopher, Basaveshwara, on the banks of River Thames. He will also take part in the 885th Basava Utsava in London. Neeraj Patil, a former mayor of Lambeth Borough in London has confirmed PM's participation on April 18. Political experts say that the move will have political significance in light of the ongoing Lingayat issue.  Apr 16, 2018 9:52 am (IST) Congress president Rahul Gandhi is set to tour Karnataka on April 26, 27 and from May 3 to 10. The rally on May 10 will be organised on a large scale in Belgaum. Gandhi has completed six rounds of campaigning in the state with the last one on April 7 and 8. Polling will be held in Karnataka on May 12.   Apr 15, 2018 10:55 pm (IST) The BJP's central election committee (CEC), which comprises Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, met today to finalise the party's candidates for the May 12 Karnataka assembly polls. The BJP had declared its first list of 72 candidates on April 8. The party's top brass is believed to have discussed probables for the remainder seats in the 224-member assembly. Sources said names of more BJP candidates are likely to be announced in a day or two. The BJP is seeking to come back to power in the state, dislodging the Congress. H D Deve Gowda-led JD(S) is the third major player in the contest. The results of the election will be declared on May 15.  Apr 15, 2018 9:58 pm (IST) NA Haris, the MLA from Shanthinagar, has rushed to meet CM Siddaramaiah after his name was not featured in the list of 2018 candidates. The Congress will announce the names for 5 constituencies later. His son Mohammed Haris Nalapad brutal assault of a man at a prominent Bengaluru café seems to have cost him dear. Party insiders said that Congress is worried that even if Haris is able to win his seat, they may lose out on four or five other seats in Bengaluru purely because of the reputation he has acquired.  Apr 15, 2018 9:55 pm (IST) Former excise minister HY Meti, who was embroiled in a sex scandal that had cost him a cabinet berth, has got a ticket from Bagalkote. Party top brass says that winnability is the only criteria. A CD of the former minister had surfaced in the media in December 2016, in which he was allegedly seen having sex with a woman. Meti had quit after the local media went to town with the CD allegedly featuring him and a government employee, Vijayalakshmi. The woman had initially accused Meti of seeking sexual favours from her for a transfer and for her contract to be made permanent. Meti was given a clean chit by the CID last year.  Apr 15, 2018 9:26 pm (IST) CM Siddaramaiah seems to have an upper hand in the list as many of his supporters have gotten seats. In Hyderabad-Karnataka region, Mallikarjun Kharge has got seats for some of his people. The party has given seats to about 40 Lingayats and around 23 Vokkaligas. OBCs have been given roughly 50 seats while Brahmins have got 5. Smaller upper castes like Vaishyas, Bunts, Kodavas etc have got 1-3 seats each.  Apr 15, 2018 9:07 pm (IST) The Congress has also not announced any candidate from Melukote yet. There is a possibility that the party will support Swaraj India candidate Darshan Puttanaiah, the son of farmer activist Puttanaiah, who had died two months ago. Bengaluru mayor Sampath Raj will contest from CV Raman Nagar constituency.  Apr 15, 2018 9:04 pm (IST) Of the five constituencies from where Congress has not yet announced candidates for is Shanthinagar, the seat of NA Haris, who got embroiled in a controversy after his son Mohammed Haris Nalapad brutally assaulted a man at a prominent Bengaluru café. Party insiders said that Congress is sure of a victory here as it is a minority dominated constituency. However, they are worried that even if Haris is able to win this seat, they may lose out on four or five other seats in Bengaluru purely because of the reputation. So, not giving a ticket to Haris may help in other city segments. With 28 seats, Bangalore Urban is the single biggest chunk and is crucial for Congress.  Apr 15, 2018 8:58 pm (IST) Among the battles that will be keenly watched will be between former Mayor Padmavathi, who will contest against BJP veteran Suresh Kumar. Congress had always fielded Manjula Naidu against him till now and lost every time. Padmavathi is a loyalist of DK Shivakumar and had got a good reputation as a Mayor. Her term had ended in mid-2017.  Apr 15, 2018 8:54 pm (IST) Siddaramaiah's son Yatheendra has got a ticket from Varuna constituency while home minister Ramalinga Reddy's daughter Soumya has got a ticket from Jayanagar.  Apr 15, 2018 8:47 pm (IST) Contrary to expectation that Siddaramaiah will play safe and contest from two seats, he will only contest from Chamundeswari, at least if the first list is anything to go by. The Congress is yet to release names for five seats. Speculation was rife that Siddaramaiah is likely to keep a safe seat in north Karnataka region as a back-up after being convinced by his well-wishers about the dangers of relying only on the Chamundeshwari seat in view of a "deal" between JDS and the BJP there.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/edexlive-epaper-edex/this+young+college+dropout+followed+his+art+and+now+conducts+doodling+workshops-newsid-83143999| People This young college dropout followed his art and now conducts doodling workshops | It is hard for Tejo Guna to pinpoint when exactly the idle art of doodling became a serious pursuit. He also does not know how he ended up at VNIT Nagpur, pursuing Architecture. Yet somehow, the pull towards fine art remained strong and he became immersed in freelancing. Whether it was designing T-shirts for college fests, designing murals in Nagpur, Raipur, Pune and even Mumbai, or even freelancing - his art found expression one way or the other. This was until he pulled a Mark Zuckerberg and dropped out of college in January 2016. "I made the decision while I was in Mumbai in just ten minutes. I called my parents and told them immediately. Looking back, I think it was a stupid decision," says the 22-year-old, although we beg to differ.          Though I tried my hand at merchandising, I realised very soon that I am more of an artist than a businessman  Tejo Guna     Originally from Nalgonda, Guna always wanted to return to Hyderabad, his homeland, and make a name for himself in the city he grew up in. So, after dropping out, he came right back and has been busy with murals, at least until last year. Now he is conducting doodling workshops, the last one being at Collab House on March 3. He even doodled live at events like the Under 25 Summit, TEDxMahindra École Centrale, Sunday Soul Sante and at a product camp event at Microsoft. "All this while I've been a self-taught artist, but I wanted to learn beyond this," says Guna, who has recently been accepted into the prestigious Accademia del Giglio in Italy.       Guna not only loves art, but he loves travelling and photography too. It took him seven years to convince his parents of his artistic capabilities     Guna feels that one mistake that artists often commit is focusing on earning rather than on improving themselves, at least in the initial stages. "For example, those who get into merchandising try to follow trends more than creativity," says the Hyderabad lad. Maybe that's why his attempt to start an online merchandising store while in college did not take off.         In monochrome: Guna usually does all his doodles in black and white   Through our conversation, Guna constantly stresses on how important it was for him to convince his parents. He has been doing so since high school and he finally believes that they are now assured. "This has been the biggest achievement of my life," says Guna, laughing. But he is quick to assure us that his parents have always encouraged and supported him with a steady supply of sketches, books and more. "If parents don't understand it is because of the society that brainwashes them to believe that a secure job, something I was never cut out for, is everything," says Guna, who urges us to always seek the validation of our parents, who are ultimately our biggest support system.

The incident will surely give fresh headache to the cops as the police are still investigating similar cases including the sensational case involving a youth and a girl from Chandbali in Bhadrak district. The youth had allegedly uploaded hundreds of sex videos to various pornographic websites.  Few days later, the youth was found dead on the banks of Kuakhai river here. Concerned over the situation, Odisha police had earlier issued advisory to all the district SPs and public to check circulation of such videos on the internet. "An advisory has been given to all the district SPs and police officers to follow a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with cases right from examining the objectionable images and videos that are going viral on social media platforms till filing the cases," DGP RP Sharma had told after inaugurating a cyber forensic division on the premises of the State Forensic Laboratory here in November last year.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/50+per+cent+of+hyderabad+s+lakes+hit+full+tank+levels-newsid-70514423| Top Stories 50 per cent of Hyderabad's lakes hit full tank levels |  Hyderabad: Hussainsagar Lake is almost full as a result of the lake's catchment area receiving 60 mm of rainfall in intermittent showers over the past 36 hours.  On Tuesday evening, the water level reached 513.32 m. Though full-tank level is 513.41 m, no warning has been issued by the authorities. As a precautionary measure, the irrigation department has opened the sluice gates which will serve to flush out the excess water.  Shekhar Reddy, superintendent engineer of the irrigation department, said, "There is no cause for worry as the gates will flush out excess water at 600 cusecs." said. The flow of water into the lake reduced from 2,000 cusecs to 1,650 cusecs by the evening hours of Tuesday, when the there was a lull in the rains.  The Hussainsagar is not the only lake that is close to overflowing. Official sources say that 50 per cent of the lakes within the GHMC limits are filled to over 70 per cent of their capacity.  Water has reached alarming levels in the Kapra Lake and the Nagaram Cheruvu as well. The zonal commissioner of the east zone visited the fast-filling Kapra Lake to take cognizance of the situation. S. Pankaja, the deputy commissioner of Kapra, said, "At present, there is no danger. But if it rains for the next 24 hours, then lakes in the area may reach full-tank levels."  According to Y.K. Reddy, the IMD chief for Hyderabad, the depression over West Bengal is expected to move towards Chhattisgarh. "In the next 24 hours, we will get slightly more rain than on Tuesday. The rain may not be heavy, but the number of spells will increase, thus bringing more rain to northern Telangana," he said.  There has been no significant change in the water levels of the Himayatsagar and the Osmansagar.  Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 19 Jul, 1.00 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/lifeberrys+english-epaper-lifebeen/6+longest+sixes+in+the+history+of+international+cricket-newsid-78457756| Entertainment 6 Longest Sixes In The History Of International Cricket | Cricket is one of the most loved and followed sport in the World. Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am

Although the letter claims that there was never a hack, latest developments breaking out of Delhi reveal, that the private keys to the offline wallets were leaked online and the hackers siphoned with the BTC leaving no trace of the hack or transfer of Bitcoins.  Coinsecure's letter  Although users of Coinsecure were frustrated, the letter clearly stated that all victims of the hack will be compensated irrespective of the stolen funds being recovered. The police complaint accuses an insider, Dr. Amitabh Saxena as the key perpetrator in the incident.   FIR filed by Coinsecure Delhi Police Cyber Cell has registered a case was under IPC sections and Section 66 of the IT Act. The latest developments reveal that the hacker[s] deleted all the history related to the affected wallets. The missing data logs could have revealed the where the stolen Bitcoin was transferred. This incident occurred just days after the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) issued a statement stating that all RBI regulated entities will not participate in the transactions related to cryptocurrencies. We have reached out to Coinsecure and the Delhi Police Cyber Cell division, there will be more updates soon. "..No one who understands crypto doubts that the U.S. dollar will have zero value in 10 years. Why then not accept a 500% devaluation in 2 and a half years?" "Just to let you know John, you can't have a 500% devaluation. I think you mean 50%, since anything over a 100% devaluation would put you in the negative. Math is hard." "This is the exact reason why I'm buffering my crypto with physical gold and silver. Fiat will be (and in a way already is) worthless. Crypto, precious metals and land all the way!"  "I'm interested in bitcoin as a sort of bubble. It doesn't mean that it will disappear, that it'll burst forever. It may be with us for a while,"   "To me, it's interesting as another example of faddish human behavior. It's glamorous,"   "I understand not understanding the whole ecosystem is not the greatest thing when speaking to a technology in that world, but everyone is dismissing his analysis of Bitcoin on the grounds that he doesn't know what an ICO is? I'm not sure how that counters his analysis of the Bitcoin bubble. In fact, I think he would contend, that dismissing his thoughts on the bubble by saying "he doesn't know what an ICO is lol" strengthens his argument of the psyche of the Bitcoin participant being someone who 'gets it' and any contention simply dismissed as 'not understanding'."   "As an economics major, Shiller was one of my college heroes. His opinion holds weight with me."  Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 13 Jan, 12.04 am

The biggest show in the WWE industry has always caught the imagination of the wrestling fanatics, and the just-concluded 34th edition also lived up to its billing. Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey making her in-ring debut was probably the show-stopper. She teamed up Kurt Angle to defeat Stephanie McMahon and Triple H in a thrilling bout. At the same time, some can say the main attraction of the night was the much-anticipated fight between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar defeated a bloodied Reigns to retain his Universal Championship Match. The event also saw the return of The Undertaker, as he made a winning comeback by thrashing John Cena.  In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history. It is safe to say that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the event.  A bloodied Reigns lost to Lesnar But amidst all this, something unfortunate happened. WWE star Natalya suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction during the event. After being thrown out of the rind during women's Battle Royal, she fell on the floor in an uncompromising position. The cameras were quick to point out the part which was visible, much to the embarrassment of Natalya.

Arun is a native of Thiruvananthapuram but is settled in Mumbai. He has been a resident of Houston, Texas for the last four years.   Divya took to her Facebook page to confirm the news about her second marriage. Besides sharing her wedding photo, she wrote, "Thank you so much for the love, blessings and prayers. My gratitude to everyone who sent us their blessings and good wishes. #love #justmarried #blessed #wedding #gratitude #goodwishes #sreeguruvayurappantemple #sincerely."     Divya, who was one of the shining stars during the late 1990s, has worked with the actors such as Mohanlal, Mammootty and Dileep, and with directors Bharathan, IV Sasi, Sibi Malayil and Lohithadas. She has played the female lead in over 50 movies and has now started a new inning in life.  In 2016, she ended her 14-year-old marriage with Dr Sudhir Shekhar and moved back from the USA to Kochi along with her children Arjun and Meenakshi. According to reports, the actress decided to end the marriage due to Sudhir's extramarital affairs and egoistic nature. Reportedly, Divya's deep interest towards dance and acting hadn't also gone well with Sudhir. The actress opened a dance school in Houston and soon established a successful career as a dance teacher. However, her husband was not happy with Divya's career interests and wanted her to stay at home.  Sudhir allegedly asked Divya to shut down her dance school but she refused to do so. Later, she moved back to Kochi along with her children and slowly resumed her first love dancing. In an earlier interview with a popular Malayalam magazine, she expressed her feelings on her separation with her ex-husband. "I kept telling myself, I will not be weak as I am a sensitive person all my life," she said, adding, "During my separation, I was strong as it would affect a lot of people who care about me. It is this thought that gave me the strength to withstand that split." Divya was trained in Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and Mohiniyattam at a very tender age. She was crowned 'Kalathilakom' at the Kerala school kalolsavam in 1990 and 1991. She has presented a variety of Indian dance and art forms on Doordarshan. She has also performed at various Indian dance festivals and international stages throughout North America, Europe and the Gulf. Later, she started her dance class in the US. Many youngsters joined her dance school, all thanks to her popularity as an actress. She used to turn mythological tales and Biblcal stories into Bharatanatyam.

The unfortunate incident took a whole new dimension after photographs of a group of men on Monday spreading a beware sign at the Istanbul Airport. The pictures of Istanbul citizens sporting a white T-shirt with quotes displayed behind caution women visitors in India generated a lot of buzz on social media platforms and messaging application WhatsApp. The quotes: are:   "Beware in sending your females to India, #JusticeforAsifa," said one.    Another message says, "Women are not worthy as cows in India, #JusticeforAsifa."    "Women! Let India be your last country to visit, as it's your graveyard. #JusticeforAsifa," read the other one.  However, people on social media pointing out the pictures that went viral seem photoshopped.  The eight-year-old victim, who belonged to Bakerwal Muslim community was abducted on January 10 and held captive inside a temple in Rasana village of Hiranagar area. Her attackers, which included temple official and policemen, drugged and raped repeatedly before being murdered. Her body was found dumped in the adjoining forest area on January 17. The family had trouble even burying the body as some locals disallowed burial accusing the family of trying to occupy land in the name of a graveyard. Father of the victim has told the media the body was finally buried in far away forest lands. The chargesheet has revealed gory details about the crime and this has led to a public outcry in various parts of the country. All eight accused including Sanji Ram, a former revenue official and the alleged mastermind of the heinous crime were presented on Monday before Kathua Chief Judicial Magistrate A.S. Langeh amid tight security as the trial began. The trial court will hear the matter on April 28. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 17 Apr, 4.43 pma week ago4 days ago3 months ago2 months ago2 days ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/inc42-epaper-inc/transforming+the+digital+banking+landscape+with+ai-newsid-75433989| News Transforming The Digital Banking Landscape With AI |   Digital technologies are irreversibly changing the way we interact with different businesses. Many times, the play of technology behind the scene is so subtle yet widespread that we fail to notice it in action. As digital transformation slowly yet surely leaves its footprint in our lives, AI is the next paradigm shift that would drive this change .  Today, in the banking sector, customer experience has become vital to ensure good business. Banks can leverage the power of big data analytics and machine learning algorithms to study customer behavior to arrive at insights that would help in creating key differentiators and improve business performance. While incumbents of the banking industry might have viewed FinTech players as disruptors and competitors, only a synergy between these two can result in solutions that meet the expectations of the well informed and ever demanding customer.  How AI Can Boost Banking Services  Banks worldwide have been adopting basic AI solutions for some time now. What once started out as an automated customer response system that could handle a set of predefined queries has now become a dynamic virtual assistant/chatbot. These chatbots are designed to learn and evolve by handling customer queries of varying complexities. The 160 % month-on-month growth of OnChat (HDFC's Facebook Messenger chatbot) since its launch in December 2016 is a notable example of how popular such virtual assistants are growing to be. By harnessing the power of AI, such technologies can replicate human interactions to perform several different transactions related to account management, funds transfer, bill payment, and more.   At the heart of a successful AI implementation is machine learning (ML). Thanks to the huge amounts of user data being generated due to the prolific use of SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytics, and Cloud) technologies, AI based machine learning systems can evolve quickly from a rudimentary system to one that can handle complex queries in a very short time. After all, machines will never suffer from fatigue like we humans do. They are constantly collecting data, analyzing them, and evolving. All this equates to one thing - rapid change in traditional business models and whether we like it or not, it is the only way forward.  New Business Models And Fear Of Job Loss  The transition to AI-driven platforms is leading to the evolution of existing business models at banks. The move to digital not only cuts down overhead costs but also creates a pull model where users approach the banks at any time and from anywhere. The eradication of physical boundaries has resulted in new business approaches that address customer acquisition, account management, online shopping, bill payment, recharging, travel services, entertainment services, and this is simply the beginning.   As AI becomes mainstream, it is right to believe that machines would be soon performing a lot of jobs that were once performed by humans. But the fear that machines would take away most of the jobs is farfetched, at least for now. While intelligent machines could certainly perform specific tasks in the banking industry, the nature of checks and balances of our governance systems would ensure human intervention at different levels. Also, the implementation of AI would create new jobs that would need humans to fill out.  A good example of this phenomenon is the arrival of the ATM. As they increased in number, it is true that many manual tellers at branches faced job cuts. However, ATMs reduced branch workload and freed up resources that resulted in the creation of new products and services that in turn led to the hiring of new people to handle them. Reports have estimated that AI will create close to 10-15 million new jobs in India in the future. With the rise of new services and markets, the scope for job creation in the banking sector is immense. For some time to come the interdependency between AI and humans will continue because regulatory bodies would not allow for a machine to take complete control over human activities. The future of the banking sector is bright, and with AI as the catalyst that will enable delivery of bespoke products and services, enhance optimize performance, and improve business, the possibilities seem endless.

The introduction of affordable automatic cars has surged the demand drastically and now there are many different automatic transmission options to choose from. We explain all four kinds of automatics available in affordable cars sold in India. and who should choose what. Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)  Who should buy it? People looking for high fuel efficiency and affordability.  The AMT has recently become widely popular in the Indian market, especially after the introduction of the transmission in affordable cars. They are also known as semi-automatic transmission. The AMT is a low-cost transmission which is based on the manual transmission itself with a few additional equipment. These transmissions share most of the hardware with manual transmission, hence the cost of the transmission is low. AMTs are the cheapest automatic transmission currently available in the market.  The clutch of such transmissions work automatically and are operated by a servo motor, making them automatics. AMTs can be offered with both petrol and diesel engine options and the cost difference between the manual variants are not much. The AMTs are highly fuel efficient (similar to the manual models) and also offers affordable maintenance cost. The AMTs are not only available with low-cost cars but high-end sporty cars like Abarth 595 also use AMTs. The only downside is the jerky gear changes. Affordable cars like Tata Nano to Renault Duster, all offer AMTs in the Indian market. Continous Variable Transmissions (CVT)  Who should buy? People looking for refined automatics  CVTs are one of the most refined automatic transmissions. The CVTs use steel pulleys and a belt that can generate infinite gear ratios. The CVTs do not have any gears and there are no any such gear changes but only the ratio change happens. This type of transmission is very quiet too and is widely used in the automatics scooters in India. However, CVTs can feel a bit elastic when you push the throttle all the way to create a rubberband effect. Affordable cars like Nissan Micra, Maruti Baleno use this type of transmission. CVTs can also get paddle shifters to give them a sporty look. In India, Honda cars like Jazz and City offer paddle shifters with their CVT. Dual Clutch Transmissions  Who should buy? People who want high-performance automatics  Dual Clutch Transmission is one of the most advanced transmissions available in the market. The dual clutch transmissions have twin clutch system that offers lightning-quick shifts. The two clutches take on the odd and even gear numbers separately while the gear system itself is similar to the manual transmission. There are two types of dual clutch transmissions - wet and dry. Depending on the torque of the engine dry or wet systems are used. Such transmissions are very quick to shift between the gears making them a common choice of high-end car manufacturers. Many affordable vehicles like VW Polo GT TSI, Ford Figo, VW Ameo, Skoda Rapid diesel etc are also available with the twin-clutch transmissions. Torque converters  Who should buy? People who do not have any other choice  The torque converters are the oldest kind of automatic transmissions that were once widely used in all the vehicles. Such transmission systems use planetary gear system with a turbine and impeller. There is a fluid present in the impeller that gets pushed due to the centrifugal forces and moves the turbine. Torque converters are quite outdated and are not as widely used as other types of transmissions. Torque converters also face lot transmission loss and low fuel efficiency. Cars like Tata Hexa and Mahindra XUV 500 use such transmission but they are much refined and improved. Torque converters have been around for a long time now and over the time, they have become quite reliable. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 29 Jan, 7.44 am6 days ago2 weeks ago2 days ago4 hrs ago2 weeks ago

Starting from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, nine ministers, two MPs, legislators, Speaker and even former ministers are getting ready to launch their either children or family members, reports Kannada Prabha . While seven ministers are vying to get tickets for their son or daughter, two are trying for their relatives. The number is expected to rise as the elections approaches following the internal survey that indicated a win for the ruling party in the next election. Siddaramaiah himself is giving up his Varuna constituency to his son Dr Yatndra and is planning to contest from Chamundeshwari. His close associate and minister Dr HC Mahadevappa is giving up his constituency T Narasipura for his controversial son Sunil Bose. He is reportedly planning to migrate to CV Raman Nagar in Bengaluru. Speaker Kagodu Thimmappa too is giving up his constituency Sagara to his daughter Dr Rajanandhini.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/u4uvoice-epaper-uvoice/7th+pay+commission+cpc+benefits+for+j+k+employees+explained-newsid-80007934| Jammu And Kashmir  7th Pay Commission: CPC Benefits For J&K Employees EXPLAINED | New Delhi, Jan 15: The government employees of Jammu and Kashmir state will receive benefits under the 7th Pay Commission or 7th CPC from April 1, announced the state Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu on Friday. The 7th Pay Commission recommendations will also be implemented retrospectively from January 2016 in Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, Finance Ministry has reportedly ruled out the possibility of a hike in minimum pay for the top and middle-level employees of central government beyond the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation. "I am committed to implementing 7th Pay Commission recommendations from April 1, 2018," Haseeb Drabu told the Assembly while presenting his fourth budget. He also announced the release of 1 per cent Dearness Allowance for government employees retrospectively from July 1 last year. The state government employees termed the announcement over the implementation of 7th Pay Commission's recommendations as 'a victory without war'.  "In general, it is the employee-friendly budget and we are thankful to the government for announcing the 7th Pay Commission. For us, it is a victory without war," Abdul Qayoom Wani, president of the Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC), told a Kashmir-based newspaper. Wani added that the employees were readying themselves to hit the streets if the government wouldn't have announced the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission. As far as a hike in minimum pay and fitment factor beyond the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for the central government employees is concerned, there is no clarity. There would be no hike in minimum pay beyond the recommendation of the 7th Pay Commission for the top and middle-level employees of the central government, a Sen Times report said quoting a top Finance Ministry official. "They will never be given hike in pay matrix above the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation because they do not need it," the official said. "The government have already reviewed the salaries and perks of the central government above the pay matrix level 5 and decided they do not need higher pay matrix levels," he added. The central government employees have been asking to raise minimum pay to Rs 26,000 and fitment factor 3.68 times from 2.57 times. The government had approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission on a hike in salary of central government employees in June 2016. The 7th Pay Commission had recommended a 14.27 percent hike in basic pay, raising minimum pay from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 month. Under the 7th Pay Commission, the basic salary of the lowest rank employee will be around Rs 18,000 and pay for the highest office of Chief second will be around Rs 2.25 lakh.     < Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 16 Jan, 11.28 pm
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news24online-epaper-newsonline/top+5+controversies+of+ms+dhoni-newsid-75265024| Sports Top 5 controversies of MS Dhoni! |  New Delhi, Oct 25: Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni proved to be as one of the finest Indian cricket team captain. He is always on the go whether it is on the field or off it. During his span of Indian cricket team captain, Dhoni has made some controversial statement which created major ripples in the cricket team. After holding several press conferences, even the best may make a few mistakes.   So here we present the top 5 statements that landed one of the BEST captain in trouble.      1) Lack of technique for Tests Matches: Dhoni had once commented just before the start of the crucial Australian tour that, "I do not have the technique to play Test Cricket." The statement raised many eyebrows in the cricket fraternity all over the world. Dhoni was never known for his batting technique but public acknowledgement of the same and that too just before the start of a vital test match, allegedly did not go down well with many in Indian cricket fraternity.      2) Forgetting Yusuf Pathan's name: It is widely known fact that MS Dhoni allegedly did not have much faith in the capabilities of Yusuf Pathan and problems only grew stronger after the former Indian skipper forgot his name just before the start of an ODI in South Africa. The incident happened like this: Just after the toss, Dhoni said, "Piyush, and I can not remember the fourth guy who is not playing."      3) Retirement from Test Cricket: During the Border-Gavaskar Series, MS Dhoni created ripples when he made this statement, "I don't think my body will allow me to play Tests post 2013 because I will have to see will I play the 2015 World Cup." There would have been no problem at all had this statement came at another time but making it just in the middle of vital Test Match series shocked many in the Indian cricket team.      4) Display of strength: This one wasn't a consequence of Dhoni's controversial statement but his actions instead. The entire Indian team walked into the press conference room during the World T20 in England in 2009. They posed for the camera - driving home the point that there was no rift in the team. While that might have been the case, what angered the media so much was the fact that the captain refused to address the press ahead of a crucial match.     5) Seniors are slow: The last statement can be termed as the biggest of all controversies Dhoni made. It sparked major debates in the Indian Cricket team. The statement of MS Dhoni was widely debated on TV Channels all across the world. Dhoni said about the senior players Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, "They are safe fielders but on the slower side, they can end up getting injured in big Australian grounds."  This comment landed MS Dhoni into the biggest controversy of his career. It also angered many in the Indian cricket team. While there is no doubting the fact that the skipper was well within his rights to say that, the problem arose when he raised fingers at two legends of Indian cricket Tendulkar and Sehwag.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/lifeberrys+english-epaper-lifebeen/budget+2018+the+4+phases+that+manage+budget+cycle-newsid-80234368| News BUDGET 2018- The 4 Phases That Manage Budget Cycle | Typically used to describe government budgeting, the four-phase budget cycle is also applicable to companies that operate based on a budget. Each step of the process is, in and of itself, valuable. When you look at preparation, approval, execution, and then evaluation as separate steps, your budget becomes a living document that can better help you achieve your company's aims.* Preparing the Budget The first step of the budget process is to actually generate the budget. Done right, this process starts with careful thought at the ground level as to what is needed and what new initiatives can be started. At the same time, leadership and vision from the top offers some guidance as to what the departments can expect. Once each department makes its spending decisions, their requests are sent to the decision makers for inclusion in, or exclusion from, the final document.       * Approving the Budget While the political budgeting process is a bit messy, one of its underlying principles is very meaningful for businesses. Budgets aren't approved on a yes or no basis. Instead, they're the subject of further debate. While, at times, the political process can distort budgetary priorities, businesses don't have to fall prey to that problem. Instead, the approval process can be an opportunity to take another view of how your company is spending its funds.* Executing the Budget Once a budget is passed, it isn't done. Chief executives can, if they choose, impound funds to prevent money from being wastefully spent. On the other hand, departments can request reprogramming to give them additional funds if a need arises. Most of the time, though, the money gets spent in accordance with the budget. A good budget isn't a limitation on what departments can spend. It's a financial embodiment of your company's strategy and tactics for the year.* Evaluating the Budget While the audit and evaluation process was once focused on ensuring that money was being spent in accordance with the law and and in a non-corrupt fashion, this phase of the budget has grown in scope. Now, auditing and evaluating also focuses on how effectively the money is being spent. It's not enough to see who used their money and who didn't. What really matters in government and in business is where the money generated a return.  Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 20 Jan, 12.44 pm2 months ago2 months ago2 months agoa month ago6 days ago

And when the two get combined in a single tweet, it ends up getting backlash. When we speak of Twitter and trolls, one Bollywood celebrity who is used to them is Abhishek Bachchan. () So, what happened was that in a random philosophical discussion, a fellow Twitterati tagged Abhishek Bachchan accusing him of living with his parents. And the user ended up being put to her place by junior Bachchan himself. @stillyoungest, during tweet exchanges with a friend, tagged Abhishek and said, "Don't feel bad about your life. Just remember @juniorbachchan still lives with his parents. Keep hustling everyone!"     Little did she know that she was messing with the wrong guy. Abhishek responded to her tweet, "Yes! And it's the proudest moment for me to be able to be there for them, as they have for me. Try it sometime, you might feel better about yourself."     Well done Abhishek! Not only that, when a fellow Twitterati asked Abhishek as to why did he reply, the Guru actor wittily replied, "Sometimes they need to be put in place."     This is not the first time that Abhishek Bachchan has smartly shunned a troll. Last year on December 03, 2017 when his wife Aishwarya Rai was clicked at a wedding along with their little daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan, someone on Twitter asked Abhishek if her daughter ever goes to school or not. And junior Bachchan replied, "Ma'am, as far as I know, most schools are shut for the weekend. She goes to school on the weekdays. Maybe you should try it considering your spelling in your tweet."     Another instance earlier when Abhishek Bachchan proved that he would not spare anyone saying against his wife or daughter, was when famous comedian, Aditi Mittal tweeted, "Aishwarya had to m marrying a tree first so she could marry a rock (mince Abhishek can't act no?)" To this Abhishek replied, "the question mark at the end suggests that you have a doubt, mince, there is hope for me. Yay!"    Coming back to the fact of Abhishek Bachchan still living with parents, former Miss World, Aishwarya was asked a similar question in 2005 on David Letterman's talk show. As per Hindustan Times, she had proudly replied, "It's fine to live with your parents because it's also common in India, we don't have to take appointments from the parents to meet for dinner." ()     On the professional front, Abhishek is currently shooting for Anurag Kashyap's Manmarziyaan alongside Taapsee Pannu and Vicky Kaushal. Wife Aishwarya will next be seen in Fanne Khan starring opposite Raj Kummar Rao and Anil Kapoor.  Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 18 Apr, 5.00 pmyesterday17 hrs ago2 weeks ago2 weeks ago4 weeks ago

Rashi Khanna is having a great time at the box-office. Though her recent film with Ravi Teja 'Touch Chesi Chudu' bombed at the box office, her 'Tholiprema' with Varun Tej is rocking at the box office. The film went on to collect a staggering Rs 40 crores at the box office. This is the second highest collection for a Varun Tej film.   With star heroines like Anushka, Samantha, Kajal Agarwal turning seniors, the directors are in the hunt for the next generation. Given the diverse stories, and the characterization, skin show alone cannot come to the rescue of the heroines. They need to act and dance well too.    In fact, Rashi Khanna was called for the screen test for Sukumar's Rangasthalam. The actress did not make it to the final cut. According to close sources, Rashi Khanna is being considered as the heroine alongside Ram Charan, in SS Rajamouli film.   Rashi Khanna did share screen space with Jr NTR in Jai Lava Kusa. Keeping this in mind, Rajamouli planning to rope in the actress alongside Ram Charan this time. Only time can tell, whether Rashi Khanna is really that lucky or not!

Scientists believe that the disease had its origin in non-human primates which later somehow got transmitted to humans in West-Central Asia. Over the years the disease has claimed several lives in the world. Americans are most affected by HIV virus. The main reason behind spreading of AIDS is that US Americans have anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Sharing needles or syringes, rinse water, or other equipment ("works") used to prepare injection drugs with someone who has HIV. HIV can live in a used needle up to 42 days depending on temperature and other factors. People with HIV who are using antiretroviral therapy (ART) consistently and who have achieved viral suppression (having the virus reduced to an undetectable level in the body) are very unlikely to transmit the virus to their uninfected partners. However, there is still some risk of transmission, so even with an undetectable viral load, people with HIV and their partners should continue to take steps to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/10+things+about+the+all+new+bajaj+pulsar+that+you+should+know-newsid-84884499| News 10 things about the all-new Bajaj Pulsar that you should know | Bajaj Pulsars have been around for a long time now. The current design of the Bajaj Pulsar was introduced way back in 2010 and since then, the baseline Pulsar models like the Pulsar 150, 180 and 220 are bringing the same design forward with slight changes. That is set to change soon as Bajaj is working on the all-new generation of Pulsars and here's everything that you want to know about them. Will get new looks Picture used for representational purposes only The current generation of original Pulsar trio - Pulsar 150, Pulsar 180 and Pulsar 220 all look a little out of date now. The new generation of bikes will get many refreshed parts that will add a new look to the line-up. Bajaj will update the new Pulsars with a new tail section, that is expected to look sharp and modern when compared to the current models. The bikes will also get different swing arms and new alloy wheels to catch the attention. However, nothing has been said about the shape of the tank. the iconic shape may be retained to carry forward the silhouette of the current gen Pulsars.  New features too    The new Bajaj Pulsar will become modern with the update. The new bike will borrow many features from the flagship bike, Dominar 400. One such feature will be the LED headlamp unit. The Dominar was the first Bajaj bike to get an all-LED headlamp. The new gen Pulsars will come with the similar feature. The new range will also get rear monoshock. Advanced engines Picture used for representational purposes only Bajaj is working on new generation of engines for the new Pulsars. The new engines are being developed from scratch. The new engine will get features like fuel injection to meet with the more stringent pollution norms. As the Pulsar bikes have always been known for their performance, features like 4 valve will also be standard. This will make the new Pulsars even more exciting. Bajaj is working to make cleaner BS VI compliant engines that will debut with the new Pulsars. The new engines will be much cleaner than the current BS-IV compliant engines. The Indian government has set a deadline of 2020 for the introduction of BS VI vehicles in India and the new Bajaj engine will be future-ready. Fewer vibrations One thing that the current generation of Pulsars is criticised for is the vibrations. The engine is not as refined as many rivals of the bike. This harshness creates vibrations that make the Pulsar quite uncomfortable, especially during the long rides. The new generation of the Pulsar will get much more refined engines, which means a fewer number of vibrations and much better comfort than the current generation bike. Will be safer The new Pulsar range will get standard single-channel ABS. This will make them much safer than the current breed. Currently, Bajaj does not offer ABS with the Pulsar 150, 180 and 220. The Indian government has also made the ABS mandatory for all the 125cc and above motorcycles launched after 1st April 2018. Better outputs With the new engines that get fuel injection in the new Pulsar, the maximum power output will improve which means the bikes will offer much better performance than the current generation bikes. Because of the addition of the fuel injection, it will also mean that the new Pulsars will be fuel efficient too. This will be a winning situation as lower fuel input and more power output will make the customers happy. Will be significantly expensive Picture used for representational purposes only With additions like new engines, fuel injection, LED headlamps and ABS, the motorcycle will become significantly expensive than the current versions. The fuel injection and ABS are quite expensive and are expected to add at least Rs. 15,000 to the cost. With the arrival of mandatory ABS and stricter pollution compliance, the prices of all the two-wheelers are expected to go up. No more Pulsar 180 The Pulsar 180 is sandwiched between the Pulsar 160 and the Pulsar 200. In the new avatar, the Pulsar 180 will be almost similar to the Pulsar 200, which will leave a very thin gap between the two models that will confuse the customers. To remove this confusion, Bajaj may do away with the Pulsar 180 when the all-new generation arrives. A bigger Pulsar in sight The new engine platform will have flexible displacement and will be able to go up to 220cc. But Bajaj is said to be working on the Pulsar 250, which can be launched with the next-generation product line-up. Currently, the 220cc displacement is the largest that you get in Pulsar. Also, there is no bridge between the Dominar and the Pulsar range. The new 250cc Pulsar will bring these two bikes closer in the product line-up. Launch soon Picture used for representational purposes only The new products are expected to be launched by 2019. This will be before the 2020 deadline of BS VI compliant engines. This will make sure that Bajaj stays ahead of the game with their products placed well in the market before the deadline. We think that Bajaj will start testing their new products soon and the launch will happen at around the festive season of 2019.  Source  Dailyhunt	|Monday, 02 Apr, 9.02 pm3 days ago4 weeks ago

The actress had little idea she was in for an awkward conversation when she attended a recent award function. And this unpleasant conversation was with none other than actor Arjun Rampal.  Rumor has it that Arjun gave Swara an hour-long lecture on how she could have avoided writing the letter and how it would affect her career in future.    But the cherry on the cake is that this whole saga was orchestrated by none other than Swara's PRO. Our source, an onlooker standing close to her, said, "In fact, the PRO kept telling Swara again and again that Arjun wished to converse with her. Out of courtesy, Swara fulfilled his wish. But she was disappointed with Arjun's advice. She was firm in her stand and said to him 'I felt whatever I have written in the open letter and I am fine with it. I do not regret it.'"  It turns out, her PRO was also handling the film Padmaavat and was upset about the open letter.  According to our source, "It is at this point that Swara's PRO wanted to discontinue working with her. Swara was fine with the decision and started preparing to take care of her work." As for Arjun, we bet he's now feeling rather silly for getting involved in this whole affair!

Any article with a metal comprising jewelry, clothing with metallic threads, zip fasteners, metallic buttons, underwire and even medicinal implants - are not permitted within the MRI room.  Image Source     The awful episode took place on January 27 evening when the 32 year old Rajesh Maru was addressing an elderly family member, who had arrived for a magnetic resonance imaging scanning at the BYL Nair Charitable Hospital.  The family members stated that the hospital ward boy had asked Mr. Rajesh to take the cylinder in the room. Mr Maru's relative Harish Solanki, whose mom was the patient said, "When we told him that metallic things aren't allowed inside an MRI room, he said 'sab chalta hai, hamara roz ka kaam hai' (it's fine, we do it every day). He also said that the machine was switched off. The doctor as well as the technician didn't say anything,"  Image Source     "As soon as Rajesh entered with the cylinder, it turned out that the machine was on," Mr. Solanki said. The metal present in the cylinder triggered the MRI machine's hideous magnetic flux, attracting both the person as well as the cylinder with huge force, bystanders stated. Rajesh's hand got trapped in the MRI machine together with the cylinder, sparking off a massive oxygen leakage. Mr. Solanki and the hospital ward boys made attempts to pull Rajesh out of the MRI machine however his body got puffed-up and he was shedding blood profoundly. He was taken to the emergency room where he lost his life in just 10 minutes.  Image Source     "It's because of their carelessness that Rajesh died," Mr. Solanki stated, blaming the hospital team for carelessness and asking for a strict action against the mistaking medical doctor as well as ward boy. Local BJP lawmaker MP Lodha has demanded compensation and stern action against those responsible for Mr. Maru's death. A police case has been registered against Dr. Siddhant Shah, ward boy Vitthal Chavan and ward attendant Sunita Surve for causing death by negligence. Dr. Siddhant Shah and ward boy Vitthal Chavan have been arrested. The hospital is conducting an inquiry and action will be taken, said Dean Dr. Ramesh Bharmal.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/u4uvoice-epaper-uvoice/7th+pay+commission+cpc+benefits+for+j+k+employees+explained-newsid-80007934| Jammu And Kashmir  7th Pay Commission: CPC Benefits For J&K Employees EXPLAINED | New Delhi, Jan 15: The government employees of Jammu and Kashmir state will receive benefits under the 7th Pay Commission or 7th CPC from April 1, announced the state Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu on Friday. The 7th Pay Commission recommendations will also be implemented retrospectively from January 2016 in Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, Finance Ministry has reportedly ruled out the possibility of a hike in minimum pay for the top and middle-level employees of central government beyond the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation. "I am committed to implementing 7th Pay Commission recommendations from April 1, 2018," Haseeb Drabu told the Assembly while presenting his fourth budget. He also announced the release of 1 per cent Dearness Allowance for government employees retrospectively from July 1 last year. The state government employees termed the announcement over the implementation of 7th Pay Commission's recommendations as 'a victory without war'.  "In general, it is the employee-friendly budget and we are thankful to the government for announcing the 7th Pay Commission. For us, it is a victory without war," Abdul Qayoom Wani, president of the Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC), told a Kashmir-based newspaper. Wani added that the employees were readying themselves to hit the streets if the government wouldn't have announced the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission. As far as a hike in minimum pay and fitment factor beyond the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for the central government employees is concerned, there is no clarity. There would be no hike in minimum pay beyond the recommendation of the 7th Pay Commission for the top and middle-level employees of the central government, a Sen Times report said quoting a top Finance Ministry official. "They will never be given hike in pay matrix above the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation because they do not need it," the official said. "The government have already reviewed the salaries and perks of the central government above the pay matrix level 5 and decided they do not need higher pay matrix levels," he added. The central government employees have been asking to raise minimum pay to Rs 26,000 and fitment factor 3.68 times from 2.57 times. The government had approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission on a hike in salary of central government employees in June 2016. The 7th Pay Commission had recommended a 14.27 percent hike in basic pay, raising minimum pay from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 month. Under the 7th Pay Commission, the basic salary of the lowest rank employee will be around Rs 18,000 and pay for the highest office of Chief second will be around Rs 2.25 lakh.     < Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 16 Jan, 11.28 pm

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Ashish Vidyarthi? | At least two videos on YouTube showed actor Ashish Vidyarthi as the father of Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love Story's wink sensation Priya Varrier. But is it true? Absolutely not. Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago

Abusive chants started to pick up at the very beginning when Stephanie McMahon showed up to address the crowd. They literally used insulting words which were not appropriate for a PG TV show. From that perspective, it was definitely not something funny and not appreciated. Good debut for Ember Moon. A nice showcase match for her. She looked great with all her stuff. Hopefully they utilize her well on the main roster. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  The series of debuts and returns were inevitable for the post-Wrestlemania episode of WWE Raw. It started with the former WWE NXT Women's Champion, Ember Moon. It was good to see her getting the spotlight during her debut match. She pinned the former women's champion which is quite an accolade and will set her up for future accolades.  A similar showcasing return was seen for Bobby Lashley and the other NXT superstars, as well. We all knew it was coming, but that was a stunning announcement from Paige on her retirement. Paige gave a really nice and emotional speech about her love of the business. Powerful stuff. My heart goes out to her. She's still so young. Nice it all came full circle in NOLA. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  The feud between Sasha Banks and Bayley continues on WWE Raw, but the heart-breaking news of Paige getting retired from the in-ring competition was also announced. It's hard to believe she had to hang up her boots at an early age of just 24. One of the most popular superstars of this generation who can accomplish much more in her career which was cut short. Good comeback for Samoa Joe. Joe would be an excellent rival against Brock Lesnar. The Roman Reigns promo didn't do anything for me. I felt like last night was the night to pull the trigger. Not doing it... yikes. What are they holding off for? Not good. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  The promo delivered by Roman Reigns following the Wrestlemania loss was much cooler, as the fans did not enjoy it much. But, they did enjoy the return of Samoa Joe in the main event capacity. He is going to be huge fit for Roman Reigns' opponent in the near future. This is a mouth-watering rivalry that will get renewed on WWE Raw. Huge pop for Jeff Hardy's return. No sign of Brother Nero. Hardy looks like he'll slide right into the Intercontinental Championship picture. Good segment all around. I particularly liked The Miz and his complaining. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  Furthermore, a standing ovation was reserved for Jeff Hardy on WWE Raw after missing six months of action due to injury. Showing up in his original character instead of Brother Nero was a major surprise for the crowd. He lived up to the expectations by giving high-flying entertainment during the main event match which ended the show on light not. A ton of new debuts, good segments, and good matches highlight a three-hour #RAWAfterMania that just flew by. I really enjoyed myself tonight. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  Check out one of the best episodes of WWE Raw in 2018: Looking forward to this......#RAW #RAWAfterMania pic.twitter.com/WHeCNSIyat— Mark Hainsworth (@bcafcmark) April 10, 2018  ok this segment was actually fantastic. #RAW #RAWaftermania pic.twitter.com/2vVpz2r6Ur— Pro Wrestling Sheet (@WrestlingSheet) April 10, 2018  "And if anyone knows about failure it's a guy who spent a decade in TNA" - @SamoaJoe #RAW— WWE Creative Humor (@WWECreative_ish) April 10, 2018  "If they continue to put me in matches with @BrockLesnar, the story will end with me becoming the #UniversalChampion!" - @WWERomanReignsYou can't take the FIGHT out of #TheBigDog! #RAW #RAWAfterMania pic.twitter.com/CF9j6Devxr— WWE (@WWE) April 10, 2018  Family reunion? #RAW #RAWAfterMania @JEFFHARDYBRAND @MATTHARDYBRAND @WWEBrayWyatt pic.twitter.com/hQ9dRG4303— WWE (@WWE) April 10, 2018  IS THIS REAL LIFE?!?!?

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/lifeberrys+english-epaper-lifebeen/6+longest+sixes+in+the+history+of+international+cricket-newsid-78457756| Entertainment 6 Longest Sixes In The History Of International Cricket | Cricket is one of the most loved and followed sport in the World. Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/newsbytes-epaper-newbyt/online+clothing+rental+market+set+to+boom+says+report-newsid-66219003| Latest Online clothing rental market set to boom: says report |  Online clothing rental market set to boom: says report  10 Apr 2017 An Alliance Market Research survey predicted that online clothing rental market would register compound annual growth rate of 10.6%, reaching $1856 million by 2023. A rapidly growing market, online clothing rental is said to be gaining popularity within developing economies in Asia Pacific, due to the need for an economic option. Increasing popularity of e-commerce further welcome start ups to this business.  Online clothing rentals  About Online rental services are expected to be utilized by those who are fashion conscious, but lack finances to procure clothing items. Rental services are considered cost effective especially for women. Ethnic wear is an item of particular interest in the market. Ethnic wear rental market is expected to expand given increasing incidence of festivals and other events and high costs associated with them.  How was the report prepared?  Fact The report has incorporated data from interviews with top officials as well as online/offline research and expert consultations. Major companies including American companies Lending Luxury and Le Tote, Indian companies Secret Wardrobe and Shared Wardrobe and Brazilian company Dress &Go were profiled. What drives the market?  Drivers North America and Europe hold the highest market share. Asia Pacific is third with a projected CAGR at 11.4%. Online rentals are expected to catch on in developing Asia Pacific economies including India and China due to increasing purchasing power complemented by dearth of economical fashionable options. Increased social acceptance for rentals and flourishing e-commerce facilitated by a technology boom also helped the market.  Booming online rental businesses in India  Key players Start-ups have been mushrooming in India's online fashion rental space, with the existing ones attracting seed funding. Increasing preference for high-end fashion goods alongside a lack of affordable options have made room for major ventures including Flyrobe, Swishlist and Klozee. Often charging a security deposit along with the rental fee, the order is delivered anywhere between 3 hours and 2 days.  Imagine no possession  Details While North America is the market leader, Asia Pacific is soon purported to catch up through demand driven growth fuelled by India and China. While women's market share comes up to 58%, number of male consumers is projected to increase. Ethnic wear along with the western wear segment is further expected to increase market share. The market can trigger a "no ownership" fashion culture.  Will the Indian market reach its potential?  Future Often selling major brands and designer wear, the start-ups are booming when Indians get smarter about their fashion expenses. Further consumers exhibit a decreasing propensity to spend on luxury one time events like festivals or bachelor parties. Societal pressure to appear fashionable might potentially end financial culture structured around long term investments, to one that provides a cheaper, yet larger array of options.  Recovery: The down side  Fact Shilpa Bhatia, an early entrant in the rental market, notes cost recovery is challenging, "We also have to look after the maintenance of the garment. I remember purchasing a gown worth Rs. 4 lakh and there were no takers. How do I recover that money?"Dailyhunt	|Monday, 10 Apr, 7.10 am

The system was introduced by Police and Transport Department in the city in August last to curb violation of traffic rules by fixing points for various violations, with the accumulation of 12 points to mean punishment in varying degrees. The RTA's latest update for the mWallet will help users know how many points they had accumulated, since exceeding 12 points could cancellation of driving license.  It was only earlier this month that one person finally accumulated more than 12 points, 14 to be precise, resulting in the police issuing a notice to him, with action on his licence to be decided shortly. Most of the violations in that particular case were related to not wearing helmets. "After updating the app with the penalty point system, it has become more helpful for motorists making them aware of points that they had crossed and urges them to be careful while driving," said Rudra Teja, developer of mWallet. The app is already one of the most popular government mobile apps, having registered nearly 25 lakh users with a rating of 4 stars out of 5 on Google Play Store. On the other hand, there are 2, 500 to 3,000 new users being registered every day, thus making the app the most downloaded one in any State, officials said. After the integration of e-challan with mWallet, citizens are coming forward to pay their fines through the app, they said. The department is now working on integrating the pollution certificate as well in the app. J Panduranga Naik, Joint Transport Commissioner, said: "The positive feedback for the app is encouraging the department to work more on it. There have been suggestions to add an option to include the pollution certificate as well and we are working on it." Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 17 Jan, 1.19 am

As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm3 months ago4 days ago2 months ago

Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India.

Arpita Khan Sharma, who considered as the most loved sister of 'Khandaan.' We have always seen Salman Khan and his family shower love and care on this 28-year-old daughter of their family. The entire fans of Bollywood admire the Khandaan for being such a sweet family. Arpita Khan Sharma who turned 28 on August 1, despite never being a part of Hindi Films, has always been a popular name among the fans of Bollywood. She has always been the talk of the town, for all the good reasons of course. Arpita who is the youngest sister of Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail Khan, is very close to her brother and especially an apple of Salman's eye. When the news of Arpita wedding with her longtime boyfriend Ayush Sharma surfaced, it made it to the headlines of all the leading newspapers, mags and channels.  Needless to say, that when it came to his adorable sister Arpita's wedding, Salman and the entire 'Khandaan' didn't leave a stone unturned to make it a fairytale one. So, on this auspicious occasion of Rakhi, we are here to tell you something about the most fortunate sister of tinsel town. Here are some lesser-known facts about Arpita Khan Sharma's life, we bet you didn't know.  Arpita was born on August 1, 1989. Despite not being a biological daughter of Salim Khan, she has always been the most loved member of their family.   It is said that Arpita was adopted by Salman's parents Salim and Salma Khan. There are different stories around in the media, around her adoption.   While some say that Arpita's mother was a beggar and lived on a footpath. She died right after giving birth to Arpita. And Salim and Salma spotted this infant near her dead body on the footpath they were passing by. Hence, they brought her home along and decided to make her a part of their family forever.   The reports in the media also state that Salim's second wife Helen was the one who adopted Arpita. This is how Arpita became an Angel from an orphan.  Very few people know that Arpita has really got a great fashion sense. She is a fashion graduate from London College Of Fashion and holds a degree in fashion marketing and management.   Before Arpita got married to Ayush Sharma, she used to work for an architectural and interior designing firm. This Beti of 'Khandaan' dreams of owning her own fashion brand one day.  In the year 2014, Arpita got a tattoo of a star, which contains the names of all her family members. The tattoo has got Salim Khan, mothers Salma and Helen, brothers Salman, Arbaaz. Sohail, sister Alvira and friend Deeksha.   This isn't much known that when Arpita dated Arjun Kapoor for two years. When Arpita and Arjun were in a relationship Arjun weighed 140 Kgs. But fate had some other plans for this couple. Arjun and Arpita broke up and the reason for their split is still not known. Seems like their break up didn't affect Arjun's terms with Khandaan and especially Salman Khan, Coz he is still close to that family.  Once again, cupid struck Arpita when she met Delhi based businessman, Ayush Sharma. Ayush hails from Delhi and belongs to a royal family. Unlike Arpita, Ayush has got plans to make Bollywood debut soon.  Arpita's wedding with Ayush Sharma is considered as the most expensive wedding of B-town. If the reports are to be believed, Arpita always wanted to get married in a palace. Ergo, Salman who can make all possible efforts to make his sister's wish come true booked the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad for her wedding. Her fairytale wedding was a Star studded affair.  Arpita is now happily married to Ayush and gave birth to a baby, Ahil, in March 2016. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 14 Aug, 6.41 am

Every season, the tournament witnesses 51 days of fan fest with every state supporting its team. This time around, Reliance Jio does not want its subscribers to miss any action on the field and is offering exclusive IPL 2018 recharge to keep them updated with live match streaming right on their smartphones. The company has a special Rs. 251 recharge pack for IPL fans that offers 102GB of data with a validity period of 51 days. Besides, Jio has also rolled out live video games on its MyJio app that offers cool prizes to the participants. Let's take a look at what are the pre-requisites to play games on the MyJio app and what are the offers.  Jio IPL 2018 Live Video Games: Offers and Prizes The Jio game dubbed Jio Cricket Play-Along lets users win prizes while they watch IPL 2018 tournaments live on the MyJio app. The game is played live alongside the ongoing cricket match. It pops up some question during the live match streaming and by answering those, users can win prizes. The game can be played in 11 languages and will be available for all the IPL matches. Jio posted a video on its official Twitter handle explaining the new game and how to play it. Khiladi khelenge, aur jeetenge aap. Watch this video to make the most of #JioCricketPlayAlong. https://t.co/LKhTFw5rHP #JioCricket pic.twitter.com/k3ZSQIcst1  - Reliance Jio (@reliancejio) April 7, 2018  Jio IPL 2018 Live Video Games: How To Register For The Game As shown in the video above, the Jio users will first need to open the MyJio app and then tap on the Play Now option.

The game will include question such as,"How many runs will be scored in this over?" there will be four options for answer - 1-10 runs, 11-15 runs, 16-20 runs and over 20 runs, if you guess the right answer then your profile will be credited with points. Depending on the points, winners can win big prizes. Most of the questions in the game are based on the ongoing match in the IPL 2018 and these questions are evenly based on the best guess the player can have for the game. IPL 2018 Fever: What Other Telcos Are Offering Not just Reliance Jio, other telcos like Airtel and BSNL are offering exclusive IPL 2018 packs and services. The next two months will see telcos trying to win over each other in the battle of grabbing the attention of around 700 million sports fans in India who are expected to stay glued to the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018. The main objective of companies will be to fetch heavy data users during the season as they watch the livestreaming of these matches on their smartphones. This way, the companies will be able to push average revenue per user (ARPU) in two months. While BSNL's special IPL recharge pack that offers 3GB data per day is limited to 3G speeds, Airtel took a different route by partnering with Hotstar to provide its subscribers with live streaming of matches and highlights on the Airtel TV app. Interestingly, Airtel has also started offering MIMO Pre-5G services at IPL 2018 venues for its users. The first venue to get the service is Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The battle is not just limited to sports, in the past few months we have witnessed telcos in India trying out different means to push users towards greater data consumption. For example, Airtel has started offering free Amazon Prime subscription to the users who recharge for more than a specific amount. Similarly, Vodafone India is offering free Netflix subscription to its users while Idea Cellular has tied with Indian content providers like Eros, ALT Balaji (also on Airtel TV app) and Sony Music. And as for Jio, it has got some original content, thanks to Reliance's ownership of the Network 18 group. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 13 Apr, 5.31 ama week ago2 weeks agoa week ago2 days ago3 days ago

Maruti has just announced a brand new micro SUV, which will enter the market by the end of next year. Hyundai has also announced a similar product. Here's the wrap. Maruti Future S  Maruti will showcase the Future S micro SUV in concept form at the 2018 Indian Auto Expo. The market launch of this car will happen either by the end of 2018 or early 2019. The Future S will use the lightweight HEARTECT platform and is expected to be fitted with 1.2 liter K-Series petrol and a brand new turbo diesel engine developed in-house by Suzuki. Manual and AMT options are likely while front wheel drive is expected to be standard. The Future S will take on the likes of the Mahindra KUV100 and Hyundai's upcoming micro SUV.  Hyundai micro SUV   Hyundai has also announced that it's working on a micro SUV for the Indian car market. However, not much is known about the vehicle except that it'll be launched in 2019, or beyond. The new Hyundai will sit under the QXi code-named, sub-4 meter SUV as the South Korean automaker's lowest priced SUV offering. Let's hope the automaker surprises us at the Auto Expo by showing a glimpse of the new micro SUV. Renault Kwid-based micro SUV  Render courtesy IAB  A Kwid-based SUV is coming, and it's expected to use the CMF-A+ platform, which is essentially a stretched version of the hatchback's underpinnings. To measure well under 4 meters in length, the new Renault micro SUV is expected to be a low cost offering designed specifically for emerging markets such as India and Brazil. While a petrol engine is a given, it remains to see if Renault will engineer a diesel for the CMF-A+ platform. Mahindra KUV100 Electric  Mahindra will launch an electric version of the KUV100 micro SUV next year. Specs have already been revealed, and they're impressive to say the least. The KUV100 Electric is touted to go 350 Kms per charge of its lithium ion batteries, with a 186 Kph top speed and a 11 second 0-100 Kph timing. This EV is expected to be shown at the 2018 Indian Auto Expo, followed by a launch later this year.  Dailyhunt	|Friday, 12 Jan, 5.59 am

However, none of the mosques have been destroyed in such acts of vandalism.  Notably, Jammu and Kashmir government on Thursday while replying to the question of BJP MLA in state parliament said that in the last two decades of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, nearly 208 Hindu temples have been destroyed in various acts of vandalism. "Of the 438 temples in the Valley, 208 had been damaged over the years," it said. The government further said, "A total of 63 hectares of land were under the 436 temples in Kashmir. There was no case of encroachment on these lands so far." "In south Kashmir Kulgam district nearly 85% of the 754 structures have been damaged," government added.  Notably, Srinagar ranks first with 57 temples being destroyed with Anantnag, coming close to second having 56 temples being destroyed by militants. Interestingly, the authorities have kept shut on the cause of such destruction and have been cautious in not blaming the entire episode of vandalism on the militants. On the other hand, Sanjay Tickoo of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a body of Kashmiri Pandits disputed the government figures, claimed that around 550 temples were damaged and 50,000 canals have been encroached upon.

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm3 months ago4 days ago2 months ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/mumbai+live+english-epaper-mliveng/aditi+sharma+gets+candid+about+her+debut+show+kaleerein-newsid-81492601| Entertainment Aditi Sharma gets candid about her debut show Kaleerein | At the press conference of  Zee Tv's Kaleerein , we met this beautiful and chirpy newbie of telly town Aditi Sharma  who seemed to be all excited for her debut show. The actress has pursued Mass communication degree from Delhi University. She always dreamt of becoming an actress. "I always wanted to be in front of the camera and therefore pursue acting as a profession. My parents were very much happy with my decision. They are very supportive and have always allowed me to do what I want" , says Aditi. Kaleerein gives out a message to all the to be brides to be herself and not to change in order to find a perfect match. While conversing with Aditi about the show we recalled her (Meera's) dialogue from the promo-  "Shaadi usi se karungi jo samjhega mujhe"  and asked her how she perceives the line and the concept of the show, "Each show has a different tale to tell. I feel till date we have seen many stories which are portrayed on subjects like education to a girl child, female feticide, and domestic violence; but this is a different subject which deals with a girl's marriage and the behavioral changes that her family members or would be in-laws wish to bring. As Meera, I would refrain all this and would expect that a guy should accept me as I am. I don't want to be anybody's shopping list!" , avers the 21-year-old actress. On being asked about her real-life prince charming, Aditi mentions, "In real life too I will never change for a person. If acting is my profession, then I wish that my would-be husband and his family should accept this. For the moment, I haven't thought about it yet, pehle career bana lu phir sochenge" . Aditi adds that she was initially very nervous but at the same time excited to give the first shot which was filmed in Patiala, Punjab. Talking about her co-star Arjit Taneja, the actress asserts, "Arjit is a very nice and a supportive person. He helps me with my lines and keeps encouraging to give my best."  Finally chatting about her acting inspirations Aditi says that she is enthralled by Priyanka Chopra's personality, Deepika Padukone's acting skills, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's elegance.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

However, none of the mosques have been destroyed in such acts of vandalism.  Notably, Jammu and Kashmir government on Thursday while replying to the question of BJP MLA in state parliament said that in the last two decades of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, nearly 208 Hindu temples have been destroyed in various acts of vandalism. "Of the 438 temples in the Valley, 208 had been damaged over the years," it said. The government further said, "A total of 63 hectares of land were under the 436 temples in Kashmir. There was no case of encroachment on these lands so far." "In south Kashmir Kulgam district nearly 85% of the 754 structures have been damaged," government added.  Notably, Srinagar ranks first with 57 temples being destroyed with Anantnag, coming close to second having 56 temples being destroyed by militants. Interestingly, the authorities have kept shut on the cause of such destruction and have been cautious in not blaming the entire episode of vandalism on the militants. On the other hand, Sanjay Tickoo of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a body of Kashmiri Pandits disputed the government figures, claimed that around 550 temples were damaged and 50,000 canals have been encroached upon.

She walked with the Universe on her shoulders and made it look like a pair of wings." She is a plethora of style; full of love and life and she leaves a little sparkle wherever she goes. The above quote perfectly matches with her chic and confident personality as she is full of strong mettle and enthusiasm to achieve bigger and better every next time. I am talking about none other than the Youtube Prodigy- Sejal Kumar herself. Born on 1st January 1995, Sejal Kumar is a 22-year old YouTuber  based out of Delhi. Her mother, Dr. Anjali Kumar is a famous gynecologist, working with Artemis Hospital. Her father, Anil Kumar is a retired army major. Sejal Kumar has an older brother named Rohan. She did her early schooling from Mother's International School. After which she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the high end SRCC (Shri Ram college of commerce), Delhi University. She began her YouTube channel on August 14, 2012. She posted her first video called "summer style turkey" there on September 7, 2012 while on her first internship trip to Turkey, as she was already an enthusiast of videography. It's just a matter of time and now she has managed to get over 3,77,972 subscribers to her YouTube channel as well as gained over 2,24,000 followers to her Instagram, which acts as an extension of her channel. So much popularity and success at such a young age but all this is so well deserved and girl we are super proud ! Let's explore more about this Stylish and Chic Youtube Sensation in the interview down below. In conversation with 'Sejal Kumar' :  1) Sejal, who is the inspiration behind your 'YouTube' channel ?   One of the first YouTuber I discovered: Bethany Mota is the real inspiration behind me starting my youtube channel. She is an American video blogger and in her super cool videos she does various clothing hauls and also uploads videos of outfit ideas, makeup and hair tutorials, recipes and do it yourself crafts.   2) What are your goals when it com es to YouTube ?   My immediate goal is to get million subscribers on my youtube channel and a more long term goal is to build a sustainable business. I have enjoyed making all my videos so much that I want to keep doing this for the rest of my life.   3) What do you think is the hardest thing about becoming a youtuber ?   I think the most difficult part is to manage every aspect, the creative, business as well as the marketing aspects behind every single youtube video. It is pretty much an entrepreneurial venture and requires a lot of time commitment but if you love what you do, you will surely figure it all out.  Also read Miss Australia ! Manish Malhotra's Favorite ! MTV Splitsvilla 10 Top Catch ! Meet Alisha Farrer   4) Sejal, what's your favorite thing about YouTube community?   My favorite thing about YouTube community is that everyone is very humble and of course a lot of fun as they all do crazy things on camera.I have always believed in portraying my real self and youtube gives me the power to do that. It's like I'm living a dream with my eyes open.   5) What do you think, you could bring to the YouTube community that isn't already there ?   It took me a long time to realize what my unique point is and I can finally say that it is my diversified content. I have fashion videos, sketches, travel vlogs, dance and music videos all on my channel. It is an extension of all my interests.   6) What's the funniest thing you have ever done when you were really bored?   While I'm bored, I usually scour few of my subscribers on my social media accounts. That is something I do when I'm really bored and have nothing else to do. Being a student and a vlogger hardly leaves you with any free time though.   7) If there is one time or moment in the last year or month, that you would change, what moment would it be?   I would like to completely change the moment when my camera got stolen at The YouTube Fan Fest. I had left it in my green room for 5 minutes to be precise and it was gone. I wish I had kept it with myself throughout. I really don't understand why would anyone do such a thing.   8) Focusing on your career aspirations. Ten years from now, where do you see yourself?   Focusing on my career, I probably see myself heading a successful business. I have always wanted that and I am sure and hopeful that with continued hard work and support from my fans and followers, I will surely achieve that one day.  9) Any tips or advice for the young aspirants who are aiming to start a YouTube channel?  My only advice and tip would be that all of you young aspirants should do a lot of research before starting a channel. Start a channel only because you truly love creating videos and then just go for i and hopefully you will never have to look back.

After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

Their each move, strategy and game plan on the field is keenly followed without a miss. Such is their popularity even off the field that their personal life isn't spared either. And when we look closely at the personal life of cricketers, we find another side which is sometimes dark. While some have got involved in ball tempering, match-fixing and other on-field scandals, some other have got involved in shocking sex scandals which dented their personal as well as professional lives. Here are some star cricketers who were caught in sex scandals.  1. Shane Warne    Time and again, the king of spin, Shane Warne has proved that he is also the king of scandals. From harassing British nurse Donna Wright, to getting naughty with 25-year old models, to having fun with a Melbourne stripper, to having extra marital affairs, to kissing his girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley openly in stadium during IPL 2011, he has number of controversies to his name. 2. Chris Gayle    The Jamaican beast, known to be a party animal, garners much attention both on the field and off it due to his charming personality. He made his name to the list when he was found 'socialising' with three British women in his Sri Lankan hotel room during the ICC World T20 2012. During an interview with journalist Charlotte Edwardes of The Times Magazine, he bragged about his "very, very big bat". During World Cup 2015, a lady staff accused him of flashing his genitals. 3. Kevin Piertersen    The cricketer was dating the 'Playboy' model and 'Big Boss' contestant Vanessa Nimmo. Their relationship didn't work out for more than a month and Kevin dumped Vanessa. The heartbroken model decided to wash off the image of cricketer by revealing how Kevin was a sex addict who often pestered her to get on bed. 4. Ian Botham    Sir Ian Botham is one of the best-all rounders to ever play the game and one of the very few players to receive knighthood. But it seems, he is not that perfect in his personal life. He cheated on his while having an affair with an Australian waitress. He also had a scandalous affair with former Miss Barbados Lindy Field. 5. Shahid Afridi    Because of his good looks, Shahid Afridi enjoys massive popularity amongst his female fans across the globe. And probably that's because he got himself on the list. Before leaving for a tournament in Singapore with the Pakistani team, Afridi - along with teammates Hasan Raza and Atiq-uz-Zaman - was caught in a Karachi hotel room with a group of young women. The players claimed to be innocent but Pakistan Cricket Board dropped all three players from the squad for ICC Champions Trophy that was held later the same year. 6. Herschelle Gibbs    His personality is so charming that he easily finds a mention every time we talk about bad boys of cricket. In his autobiography, To The Point, he gave numerous of accounts of his own sex life. Describing one such instance ahead of World Cup 1999 group game against Australia, Gibbs wrote: "I just knew I was going to get a century. Perhaps the girl lying in bed beside me had inspired me. She worked at the hotel, where I had befriended her. I guess she was my lucky charm - she certainly was when it came to my batting. I just wish her powers had extended to my fielding and the bladdy dropped catch." 7. Mike Gatting    Former England captain and the recipient of Warne's "ball of the century", Mike Gatting was accused by the media for his illicit involvement with a barmaid, Louise Shipman, in his hotel room during the first Test against West Indies at Trent Bridge. He maintained his innocence but the Englsih cricket authorities didn't buy his version of truth. 8. Daryl Tuffey    Playfully known as Darly 'Huffy-Puffy', this New Zealand bowler was caught in a sex scandal in the year 2005 when two English tourists filmed him having sex with a 23-year-old girl. After the incident, the English tourists never came in front and even his hook-up claimed that she never met Tuffey. 9. Mohammad Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq    These Pakistani cricketers visited a local strip club named 'club 69' in South Africa which cost them a lot. It was believed that they got into a fight in the club and were beaten badly. But it was presented that the cricketers was 'mugged' outside their team hotel 'Sandton' and got hurt. 10. Asad Rauf    Pakistani umpire and then a part of ICC elite panel of umpires, Asad Rau made the headlines when a when a 21-year-old Indian model Leena Kapoor accused him of "sexually exploiting" her on the pretext of marriage. However, Rauf claimed that she was just a fangirl. But he couldn't prove his claim as numerous intimate pictures of the couple were surfaced on the internet.

Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am

Surprisingly, the Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Graphics Dock also has an inbuilt GPU, unlike the other graphics docks, for which you have to buy the graphics card separately. According to us, the Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Graphics Dock has a custom designed GPU, due to which, it is extremely slim. The dock has a metal chassis, and it looks very simple; it measures 248.92 x 129.54 x 22.86mm and weighs a mere 1.4 pounds;. At the front, the dock has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. At the rear, there are two DisplayPort 1.3 ports, one HDMI port, one Ethernet port, and a proprietary power adapter port. On the side, it has a USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port, which apart from providing graphics power, can also be used to charge a laptop that supports the USB Power Delivery.  Even though the GTX 1050 may not seem like a very powerful graphics card, according to Lenovo, it is good enough to power a Windows Mixed Reality headset with refresh rates up to 90Hz. However, if you are into graphics-intensive games, then this Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Graphics Dock isn't for you. Sadly, there isn't even an option to opt for a more powerful GPU in the Thunderbolt 3 Graphics Dock. Hopefully, Lenovo will launch more powerful docks in future if there is a demand. The Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Graphics Dock is priced at $399, and there is no word yet on the availability of the device. Also, Lenovo hasn't revealed any information, whether and if this product will be launched in India. If it does launch in India, we expect it to be priced around Rs. 35,000. It is to be seen how the market adopts the trend of external graphics docks, as the Thunderbolt 3 is available on a limited number of laptops and motherboard that are currently on sale worldwide.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago

Nothing is worse than finding an unexpected visitor of the bug variety in your home. Whether it be ants, spiders, or some type of rodent, no one enjoys finding a pest in their home. Although most are harmless, some surprising creatures can be potentially harmful to your health. You should definitely call an exterminator if you find this slimy creature in or around your home, and you won't believe what this terrifying worm can do in slide #6! Even the cleanest of households see their fair share of bugs within the home (shoes off at the door everyone!), and no matter how hard you try they find their way inside. All it takes is a few crumbs or an open door.   A few ants or a small spider isn't much to worry about, but if you find this creature somewhere in your home or yard you should definitely consider getting it taken care of!  This invasive little worm made its way to America through international trade, and this is not good news for the snail and slug species they prey on. This worm has no predators of its own because it tastes so awful, and this gives this species a good chance of spreading fast.  The New Guinea flatworm has been spotted in some gardens in Miami, and they typically survive in potted plants which gardeners move from one spot to another. Although their main prerogative is the consumption of snails, these slimy creatures pose a threat to larger creatures as well.  The New Guinea flatworm is even known to feast on mice and rats, and these animals can contract lungworm infections. This poses a problem for humans anywhere in the vicinity of these animals.  If humans come in contact with the air particles around an infected rodent's droppings, they can also contract an infection. This makes these disgusting creatures even more frightening.  The vomit of a New Guinea flatworm can harm human skin, so it's important to never go near or dare to touch one of these harmful worms. Their vomit contains a toxin dangerous to humans, and it's one more reason to steer clear.  This terrifying species has not been spotted outside the sunshine state, so be on alert if you plan on visiting Florida anytime soon. Share this with your friends and family down South so they know to be cautious when gardening or doing any activities outside. Better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to this worm.

Every disease shows their signs and symptoms through which we can detect them. Through these warning signs, we can realize that something is not right with our body. It tries to warn us about things like irregular periods, mood swings etc. Many women these days suffer from a condition called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome which is linked to the level of hormones. A study on PCOS revealed that one out of five women in India suffers from this condition. This is a leading cause of infertility among women today.  Here is the list of symptoms of hormonal imbalance women should not ignore. 1. Thinning of hair    This is one of the common symptoms of hormonal imbalance and it starts from head to toe. Unusual loss of hair and a receding hairline with hair falling out in chunks indicate that something is not right with your hormones. Maybe patches of your scalp start becoming visible after a point. 2. Persistent anxiety    The next effect is on your mind. This anxiety is caused when the body is not dealing with its hormones naturally. You might not feel anxious all the time, but negative emotions keep coming to you, again and again, making your gloomy for the whole day. 3. Dark circles    Dark circles are usually associated with lack of sleep or stress. You might change your sleeping pattern but the stubborn dark circle won't go away. This is because of the lack of testosterone or progesterone in the body. 4. Acne    When there is a hormonal imbalance in your body, your face too shows some signs. Acne and pimples are quite common to occur when you are suffering from hormonal balance. 5. Changes in breast    The chest area begins to change in terms of skin tissues when there is a hormonal imbalance. You might experience pain or lumps in the breasts because of irregular of irregularity in the estrogen levels of your body. 6. Sweating    Sweating is natural but excessive sweating is something you not ignore. If you sweat due to fear, the nervousness of other emotional reasons with a foul smell, it's a symptom of hormonal issues. 7. Irregular weight gain    Even though you follow a healthy lifestyle, you are gaining weight, especially in your lower abdominal area. It's probably happening due to the hormonal imbalance in your body which you should get checked to maintain your weight. 8. Fatigue    If you feel lazy even after a high adrenaline rush or feel tired after a whole night's sleep then it's probably because of imbalance in your progesterone levels.

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm3 months ago4 days ago2 months ago

From wearing the wrong size of bra to not wearing a sports bra, here are few things that can spoil the shape of your breasts. 1. Wearing wrong size bra     A study reveals that around 75% of women wear the wrong size of bra. While some women don't actually know how to pick a perfect size for them, some women wear a smaller size to make their boobs look bigger. When you do so, you are constricting your blood vessels and your breast doesn't get the support it needs.  2. Tweezing hair off your breasts    Breasts are the softest body parts and they are highly sensitive. If you use tweezers to get rid of hair from that part, you are harming yourself beyond imagination. You should rather use some gentle methods to remove hair from your breasts. 3. Breast piercing    Many women go for breast piercing in order to make their boobs look sexy. But breast piercing is not advisable because the lymph nodes lie very close to your nipples. Moreover, forget about lacy lingerie after getting your nipples pierced. 4. Working out without a sports bra    Many women don't wear the sports bra while working out. But health and fitness experts say that working out without wearing a sports bra can lead to the deformation of your breasts. It can even lead to pain as your breasts need support while jogging or doing other exercises. 5. Sleeping on your stomach    Yes, you may find this sleeping position quite comfortable but it can lead to changes in the shape of your breasts. But if you can't help but sleep in this position then you must put a pillow under yourself while sleeping. 6. Not moisturizing them    The area around your breasts is very soft and sensitive. If you don't take proper care of them by applying moisturizer or sunscreen, you are harming yourself. 7. Going for surgery to get a perfect shape    Every woman has a different shape of their breast. Comparing yourself to others and then opting for surgery is surely not an option. Breast augmentation can sometimes cause adverse results and can ruin the shape of your breasts forever.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Vu has been visible on the TV segment for quite a few years in India, Xiaomi debuted its Mi TV 4 in the country recently. Both the brands are offering premium products under budget, and it is bound to confuse the potential smart TV buyers in India. Vu CEO recently calls Xiaomi low-end brand; Claims Sony, Sharp are real competitors. The soring competition and confusion has implored us to compare Vu's Android 4K UHD LED TV (55-inch) with the Xiaomi's 4K HDR Mi TV 4 (55-inch). Below we will be comparing both the products by screen size, operating system, Refresh rate, contrast ratio, RAM, Storage, connectivity, app support, and price in India.  Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Display Regarding screen size, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV comes in three different variants - 43-inch, 49-inch, and 55-inch. However, the Xiaomi Mi TV 4 4K HDR comes in a single variant featuring 55-inch screen size. Both the TVs from Xiaomi and Vu come with 60Hz of refresh rate and 6000:1 contrast ratio. Even the pixel resolution on both the TVs is same, i.e., 3840×2160 pixels resolution. But Xiaomi's Mi TV 4 takes the cake regarding design, it boasts a bezel-less display with thinnest frame size. Vu's 4K UHD LED TV, on the other hand, comes with bezels that looks less attractive in front of the Mi TV 4. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Hardware and Connectivity Options The Xiaomi Mi TV 4 packs 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. Xiaomi claims that the internal storage on the TV will be utilized for software updates that the device will be receiving quite often. On the other hand, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV offers 2.5GB RAM and 16GB internal storage. The storage on the TV will be used for gaming and app operations, rather than incremental software updates. Regarding connectivity, the Mi TV 4 bears dual-band Wi-Fi (802.11ac), three HDMI ports, two USB ports, an Ethernet port, and Bluetooth v4.0. While the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV also settles with dual-band Wi-Fi, three HDMI ports, two USB ports, an Ethernet port. Under this comparison, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV takes the cakes with its higher RAM and storage capacities. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Software and Apps Coming to the software side of things, the Mi TV 4 runs Xiaomi's in-house PatchWall UI layer on top of Android. The company has customized the OS for Indian consumers, making it compatible with their requirements and viewing habits. The company has collaborated with Indian content providers like Hotstar, Voot, Sony Liv, and Hungama Play, and more. These services are touted to offer over 500,000 hours of content. Moreover, the Mi TV 4 can also be integrated with the set-top-box from providers like Dish TV, Tata Sky, Hathway and Siti cable. The Mi TV 4 also includes Mi remote with 11 buttons. But it works with Mi Cable that is priced at Rs. 299. On the contrary, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV runs Android 7.0 Nougat and is expected to get updated to Android 8.0 Oreo by the second half of 2018. Vu has partnered with YouTube, Netflix, Hotstar, Alt Balaji, Sony Liv, Google Movies-TV, and others to offer content streaming. The remote control for the TV includes voice control and a dedicated button for Netflix. One of the most interesting and worthy additions on the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV comprises Chromecast integration. It means that the TV comes pre-equipped with Chromecast support and the users don't need to buy the dongle separately. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Price in India Xiaomi's 55-inch Mi TV 4 is priced at Rs. 39,999, making it the most affordable 4K smart TV on the market right now. The Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV comes with a price tag of Rs. Rs. 50,990 bringing it close in competition with the Mi TV 4. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Verdict After comparing all the specs and features, we have come to a conclusion that the Xiaomi Mi TV 4 is a very strong competitor for Vu in Android 4K LED TV Segment. Though Vu is better equipped, if you are looking for an under 40k smart TV with bezel-less design, then the Mi TV 4 should be your ultimate buy. Zara writes for more blogs than we can keep count of.

The biggest show in the WWE industry has always caught the imagination of the wrestling fanatics, and the just-concluded 34th edition also lived up to its billing. Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey making her in-ring debut was probably the show-stopper. She teamed up Kurt Angle to defeat Stephanie McMahon and Triple H in a thrilling bout. At the same time, some can say the main attraction of the night was the much-anticipated fight between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar defeated a bloodied Reigns to retain his Universal Championship Match. The event also saw the return of The Undertaker, as he made a winning comeback by thrashing John Cena.  In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history. It is safe to say that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the event.  A bloodied Reigns lost to Lesnar But amidst all this, something unfortunate happened. WWE star Natalya suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction during the event. After being thrown out of the rind during women's Battle Royal, she fell on the floor in an uncompromising position.

Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

The show is running since 28 July 2008 on SAB TV.  The show is a light-comedy TV series which is inspired from the famous Gujarati writer Taarak Mehta. He wrote series of stories titled, "Duniya Ne Undha Chashma."  Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah has been a big hit on the Television because of the funny plot it follows, its quirky characters, excellent script and brilliant direction. Every character in the show has a unique identity, and viewers love them.  Of late, many prominent actors from this serial have quit it for some or the other reason. Dayaben aka Disha Vakani is in the news for leaving the show, check out the reason.  Raj Anadkat, 19-year old Mumbai resident, has now entered the show. Bhavya Gandhi, popularly known as Tipendra Jethalal Gada aka Tapu has quit the show. After eight years, the young actor decided to do something new and challenging and therefore left the show.  Mr and Mrs Bhide's daughter is Sonu in the TV show. Jheel Mehta played Sonu's role. Jheel Mehta was replaced by Nidhi Bhanushali in 2012. One of the reasons why Jheel decided to quit was that she wanted to focus on her studies. Also, she had become too tall to play Sonu's role.   Gurucharan Singh, best known as Sodhi, left the serial due to differences with the producer of the show, Asit Modi. Laad Singh Maan replaced the Sardar. But they (Asit Modi and Gurucharan) cleared the differences and Gurucharan made a comeback as Sodhi again. As a result, Laad exited the show.  Mrs Roshan's role was played by Jennifer Mistry. She quit the show because she was pregnant and was replaced by actress Dilkhush Reporter in 2013. In 2016, Jennifer got back to the show.  Disha Vakani aka Dayaben is the show's star attraction in Taarak Mehta Ka Oltah Chashmah. Her maddening jokes and queer way of speaking have made her a favourite of viewers.  The reports by DNA India says that Disha is pregnant with her first child and will go on maternity leave soon.  Dayaben will not quit the show. She will be back soon after she delivers her baby.But we will miss her. After all, her perky character has won our hearts, and it would not be easy to watch the show without her, isn't it?  The question now is whether Vakani's absence will affect the show's TRP? Time alone will tell. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 12 Jun, 6.04 pm

However, none of the mosques have been destroyed in such acts of vandalism.  Notably, Jammu and Kashmir government on Thursday while replying to the question of BJP MLA in state parliament said that in the last two decades of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, nearly 208 Hindu temples have been destroyed in various acts of vandalism. "Of the 438 temples in the Valley, 208 had been damaged over the years," it said. The government further said, "A total of 63 hectares of land were under the 436 temples in Kashmir. There was no case of encroachment on these lands so far." "In south Kashmir Kulgam district nearly 85% of the 754 structures have been damaged," government added.  Notably, Srinagar ranks first with 57 temples being destroyed with Anantnag, coming close to second having 56 temples being destroyed by militants. Interestingly, the authorities have kept shut on the cause of such destruction and have been cautious in not blaming the entire episode of vandalism on the militants. On the other hand, Sanjay Tickoo of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a body of Kashmiri Pandits disputed the government figures, claimed that around 550 temples were damaged and 50,000 canals have been encroached upon.

Well, this one will simply blow your mind. The registration number 'F1' has gone on sale in the United Kingdom for, wait for it, a whopping Rs 132 crore! Yes, you can actually have the number 'F1' on your car in the UK, provided you are willing to pay such a stratospheric amount for it. The F1 number plate has been on many cars in the UK. These include a couple of Mercedes-McLaren SLR, a few custom Range Rover SUVs, and even a Bugatti Veyron. This plate got into private hands in the year 2008, before which it was under the ownership of the Essex City Council since the year 1904. Till now, the F1 plate has been used by one Afzal Kahn. Kahn is the owner of Kahn Design, a famous UK-based car customizer.  The F1 registration plate has remained in the limelight for the obvious reference to Formula 1, the most famous form of motorsports almost across the globe. Of course, another reason for its fame is the fact that there are only a few two-digit plates around the world. This plate first went on sale for Rs 4 Crore. Its current value, however, is pegged at a mind-blowing Rs 132 crore. If sold, it will even overshadow the D5 plate bought in Dubai for a staggering Rs 67 Crore by one Balwinder Sahani. The single-digit plate '1' was sold in Abu Dhabi for Rs 66 crore.    While such custom number plates aren't available in India, one can always purchase a special number plate from the RTO. There have been many instances of people buying really expensive plates for vehicles ranging from a Honda Activa (!) to the likes of Mercedes S-Class. Last month, it came to light that registration plates with special numbers, such as 8055 and 4141, which translate to 'BOSS' and 'PAPA (in Hindi numerals)' respectively, will soon become available for sale at a higher-than-normal price. Officials feel that charging for such numbers will help the RTO maximize its earnings. Images courtesy NDTV  Dailyhunt	|Monday, 09 Apr, 7.22 pm3 weeks agoa week ago

Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love.

The girl, who was seen in the 1.7-minute-long video, is believed to be a resident of Bhadrak district. It appears that the male partner has shot their intimate moments, in the know of the girl. So far, no complaint has been registered with police in this regard. The incident will surely give fresh headache to the cops as the police are still investigating similar cases including the sensational case involving a youth and a girl from Chandbali in Bhadrak district. The youth had allegedly uploaded hundreds of sex videos to various pornographic websites.  Few days later, the youth was found dead on the banks of Kuakhai river here. Concerned over the situation, Odisha police had earlier issued advisory to all the district SPs and public to check circulation of such videos on the internet. "An advisory has been given to all the district SPs and police officers to follow a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with cases right from examining the objectionable images and videos that are going viral on social media platforms till filing the cases," DGP RP Sharma had told after inaugurating a cyber forensic division on the premises of the State Forensic Laboratory here in November last year.

The biggest show in the WWE industry has always caught the imagination of the wrestling fanatics, and the just-concluded 34th edition also lived up to its billing. Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey making her in-ring debut was probably the show-stopper. She teamed up Kurt Angle to defeat Stephanie McMahon and Triple H in a thrilling bout. At the same time, some can say the main attraction of the night was the much-anticipated fight between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar defeated a bloodied Reigns to retain his Universal Championship Match. The event also saw the return of The Undertaker, as he made a winning comeback by thrashing John Cena.  In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history. It is safe to say that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the event.  A bloodied Reigns lost to Lesnar But amidst all this, something unfortunate happened. WWE star Natalya suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction during the event. After being thrown out of the rind during women's Battle Royal, she fell on the floor in an uncompromising position. The cameras were quick to point out the part which was visible, much to the embarrassment of Natalya.

However, none of the mosques have been destroyed in such acts of vandalism.  Notably, Jammu and Kashmir government on Thursday while replying to the question of BJP MLA in state parliament said that in the last two decades of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, nearly 208 Hindu temples have been destroyed in various acts of vandalism. "Of the 438 temples in the Valley, 208 had been damaged over the years," it said. The government further said, "A total of 63 hectares of land were under the 436 temples in Kashmir. There was no case of encroachment on these lands so far." "In south Kashmir Kulgam district nearly 85% of the 754 structures have been damaged," government added.  Notably, Srinagar ranks first with 57 temples being destroyed with Anantnag, coming close to second having 56 temples being destroyed by militants. Interestingly, the authorities have kept shut on the cause of such destruction and have been cautious in not blaming the entire episode of vandalism on the militants. On the other hand, Sanjay Tickoo of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a body of Kashmiri Pandits disputed the government figures, claimed that around 550 temples were damaged and 50,000 canals have been encroached upon.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/hackers+break+into+naukri+com+steal+over+1+l+resumes-newsid-84435702| Bangalore Hackers break into Naukri.com, steal over 1 L resumes | Nigerian hackers have broken into the Naukri.com server and have stolen nearly one lakh resumes. The incident came to light after an IT firm 'Klaus' which manages Naukri.com's server registered a complaint with the CID Cyber Crime division. Officials from the CID Cyber Crime cell had written a letter to the company's headoffice in Mumbai seeking an explanation about the hack. Kalus IT Solutions representatives stated in their complaint that Naukri.com had outsourced the work of maintaining their server with the city-based IT firm over a period of time. Klaus charges Naukri.com anywhere between Rs 3 and Rs 5 to maintain each resume of millions of job seekers who register on Naukri.  The complainant also stated this is the first time the server has been hacked. Soon after they came to know about the hack, the firm took measures to protect the remaining existent database of the server. But by then, a lakh resumes were already stolen, they said in the complaint. Preliminary investigations by Cybercrime cell revealed the IP address of the laptop used for hacking originated from Nigeria. On the Naukri.com website, there is an option called 'New to Naukri' for first-time job seekers. On this option, one can upload an attachment sized 2 MB which goes to the server managed and maintained by Klaus IT Solution in the City. Klaus then retrieves the resumes from the server and matches them with requirement from companies to intimate them about job offers. Cybercrime sources said, initially, the hackers hacked the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) of the Naukri website and later they breached their server. The police suspect that within three days, the hackers downloaded at least three lakh resumes. Looting job-seekers Using the information on the stolen resumes, hackers are now contacting job aspirants faking that they are from reputed multinational companies. They are luring job seekers into paying money for back-door entries. There have been several reports of job aspirants who were cheated in a similar manner and complaints have been lodged. The hackers have used the names of companies such as Wipro, Bosch, Airtel, Accenture, and many others. If one responds to their mail, they are next asked to pay up for registration, interviews. Nearly 10,000 job aspirants have been contacted and attempted to be cheated. Senior police officials from the Cybercrime cell said job aspirants need to be careful while responding to such e-mails and verify the authenticity of the emails before they go ahead with the job offer. A few of the job aspirants have also started receiving calls stating that they were from banks and they could process loans if they are interested. Out of 808 complaints registered before the Cybercrime cell until March 23, 250 complaints were related to fake job offers and bank loans. Since Kalus IT Solutions is a vendor company involved, we have written to the chief of Naukri.com to come and register a formal police complaint, said a Cybercrime official.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/inc42-epaper-inc/somveer+anand+on+an+agritech+mission+to+bring+concept+of+urban+farming+in+india+with+startup+pindfresh-newsid-85400025| News Somveer Anand On An Agritech Mission To Bring Concept Of Urban Farming In India With Startup Pindfresh | Food today is laden with chemical fertilisers that cause some major health risks such as cancer. Fertilisers such as ammonium nitrate, cadmium, potassium chloride, organophosphate (OP), pyrethroids, etc. are used to protect vegetables against pest and premature decay. Despite the apparent impact on health, the irony is that India is now the second largest manufacturer of pesticides in Asia after China and ranks twelfth globally. "It was the importance of clean and healthy food dawned upon us. Bringing farming to the urban Indian homes, and making people aware of what they eat is the mission behind setting up Pindfresh," says Somveer Anand , founder of agritech startup Pindfresh.  For Somveer and his wife Sohila Anand, the idea to launch Pindfresh was very much based on a personal experience that he had after one of his close relative fell ill due to the consumption of chemical-loaded food. During their India visit the husband-wife duo had an hands-on experience on the extreme dearth of hygienic, nutritious food in India and this is where, they also felt, there was a dire need to provide people with the ability to grow vegetables locally. That's precisely where the Pindfresh's journey began 2016, when they were also joined in by Jaspal Singh Anand. The agritech startup Pindfresh is turning small plots or spaces between buildings or in buildings into usable farm space. From rooftop gardens, to floors specifically designed to incorporate farming, to other spaces within high-rises filled with racks of perfectly lined leaf vegetables, it is striving to bring about a farming revolution in urban India.  Apart from selling in-house home systems (hydroponic and others) and fresh produce (lettuce, rocket, basil and mushrooms), it also runs programmes to train people (in schools and societies). By using hydroponics, cocopeat gardening and other soilless techniques, Pindfresh is attempting to educate urban dwellers to use a technology which takes less space, demands lesser water and is completely free from pathogens and biological contaminants.  Organic Farming: Ushering In Organic Food Revolution   The concept of urban farming is a trend that is catching up fast globally. For instance, Tokyo-based Kono Designs started an urban farm by the name of Pasona in a nine-storey building in 2010, and this gave the employees a chance to grow and harvest their own food at work. Apart from Pasona, major companies in Japan like Mitsubishi are also leading the way to set up urban farms at their offices. Japan has become a front runner in urban farming, which is in turn helping the country cut food import costs.  India too needs to plant the idea of urban farming. Why? Here is the reason.  The urban population in India, which stands at 377 Mn, is expected to reach 600 Mn by 2031, according to a new UN-backed report. The increasing nutritional requirements of this fast-growing urban population will pose a huge challenge in the coming years. Due to the ever-increasing urban population and decreasing rural population that used to tend to frame as a traditional occupation, India imported $906.3 Mn (INR 5,897 Cr) worth of fruit and vegetables in 2016-17, while the figure in 2014-15 was $832 Mn (INR 5,414 Cr). As a result, Indian consumers are becoming victims of processed food as there is a wide gap in the supply and demand chain. To address this problem, there is a subtle movement that is taking place in India over urban farming, spearheaded by millennials. Of these, integrating farming ideas into the urban space is also Pindfresh.  As far as India is concerned, a survey on the Status of Organic Farming in India was conducted by scientists from different universities including the Indian Institute of Soil Science to ascertain the real benefits and feasibility of organic farming in terms of the production potential, economics and soil health, in comparison to the conventional farms in India. The study revealed that organic farming, in spite of the reduction in crop productivity by 9.2%, resulted in an increase of 22% in the farmers' net profit compared to conventional farming. This trend got further escalated with the coming of urban farming and today, agritech startups are not only helping farmers to assess the soil and weather conditions or crop production but are also coming up with unique ideas to optimise the limited space in urban India to grow vegetation in offices and other commercial complexes. And the best part is that the idea of organic farming is not limited to just offices; balconies, roofs, terraces, drawing rooms and kitchens in urban homes but could be seen as a future of vegetation in urban India and Pindfresh is determined to make it a reality with its advanced organic farming techniques.   Pindfresh And Their Concrete Vegetable Farms   Pindfresh's journey began with an initial capital of $7.68K (INR 5 Lakh). When the agritech startup was taking shape, the trio did a lot of research to learn about hydroponics and then tailor make it to suit the Indian conditions (or rather, that of any developing nation).    "For example, we try and promote hydroponics where the space requirements are important. For places we have no space constraint, we try and promote coco peat gardening in grow bags and feed them using hydroponic nutrients. Not being wedded to a particular technology allows us the freedom to experiment and recommend the most appropriate ways of growing our food," says Somveer. But this agritech technology or perhaps trend is soon catching up across India today.  Here is a look at how hydroponics and soilless farming is evolving in India.   According to a research pursued by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, the area under hydroponics began to expand significantly in Europe and Asia during the 1950s and 1960s, and large hydroponic systems were developed in the deserts of California, Arizona, Abu Dhabi and Iran (1970). The research elaborates that hydroponics did not reach India until 1946. By 2008, localised experiments were adopted to grow exotic crops like strawberry, green garlic and tomatoes. Today, 'Landmark Agrotech' project is the second biggest hydroponics project in Gujarat and is currently under implementation. Likewise, for Pindfresh, all the growing is done at their prototype growing facility in Nayagaon, Punjab.     Startup Pindfresh Making Systems To Flourish 'Mini Pinds'   The startup is attempting to make cities holistic in their requirements of food and vegetation. To that end, it is working towards creating systems by which people will actually eat the local and fresh produce - just as if the food is coming directly from the Pind. Essentially, they offer three services: creating and selling systems for home and commercial use; producing food using Pindfresh systems and selling it and holding workshops. The startup is grossing over a monetisation strategy that involves making the vegetable saplings available for procurement by offices and houses. They have two types of customers: one who buys the plants to grow the vegetables themselves and those who only buy the vegetables. Pindfresh is also selling to wholesale markets. "Traditionally, cities have sourced all their food and supplies from the surrounding villages. The reason why we call ourselves Pindfresh is because we want to move the production of food from the villages to the cities. We want to create mini pinds (villages) in the centre of the towns and in every household!" Somveer enumerates. The startup is planning to develop an app which can advise customers on the right way and time to water the plants, add nutrients, check the pH of the water, etc.  The Road To Augur In An Organic Revolution Via Agritech  In the two years of growing leafy vegetables and building the organic 'farm to fork' concept for the urban landscape, agritech startup Pindfresh has seen quite a number of challenges. "The major challenge we had initially was a complete lack of an agri startup ecosystem in Chandigarh (which was surprising, considering its the gateway to Punjab, the 'Bread Basket of India'. The other problems that we faced included sourcing specialised materials and equipment (that we needed to make our hydroponic equipment with) and customer education but made us realise that a HUGE opportunity existed here," highlights Somveer. Despite the challenges, the agritech startup has been well on the path of exploring the opportunity as their traction shows. It has a top line of about $6.14K (INR 4 Lakh) a month (growing at 20% M-o-M). Sold more than a 1,000 units over the last 12 months Chandigarh and Delhi are its two major traction areas As urban farming is fairly a new idea in India, Pindfresh is shaping itself to become a robust sustainable agritech startup to lead the industry amidst many people who deal with home-grown balcony systems and hydroponics. Organisations like City Farming, Earthoholics, Fresh & Local, Urban Leaves, etc. are its likely competitors. According to Somveer, "This industry has a lot of scope of becoming a rage. The main reason behind it is that it is aimed at our well-being, and health, which are the burning topics of discourse these days."    He adds, "It is well suited to the modern day lifestyle, where we are living in smaller spaces, with even lesser time to devote. Hydroponic and soilless systems are easier to maintain, requiring on an average of 30 mins a week - produce wonderful and nutritional food and flowers, are modular and DIY in nature and most importantly will not break the bank once you start!" The agritech startup is aiming to introduce consistent innovations to grow and aid to the development of urban farms in India. On the latest innovation the company is working on, Somveer mentions, "We're always thinking about how we can use hydroponics to solve other real-world problems. So, we 'invented' the Niño. The Niño is a unique vertical system (the first of its kind in India) and apart from being easy on the pocket, is very low on maintenance as well! This system can hold up to 36 air cleaning plants, looks beautiful in being placed in a corner and it not only removes formaldehyde, acetone, NOx's and COx's, etc. from the room, it also releases fresh oxygen for us to breathe and work in a healthy environment." As for the way ahead, Somveer avers that they are currently toying with the idea of raising a little bit of money for the R&D and for inventory, but prefers an investor who understands the space. The startup says it will need about $307,600 (INR 2 Cr) to roll out its rooftop system for growing plants (and that doubles as a nursery for their farmers). The founders plan to use the funds for the development of sensors and IoT systems that can predict how much food will be required at what time, what the growing conditions are going to be in the future and how much of the produce must be consumed to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  The Green Of The Future   In countries like Israel and the US, hydroponic produce is already part of the market, which is yet to happen in India. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon is perhaps one of the earliest examples of hydroponics. Urban farming, especially in the case of India, can play a significant role in urban environmental management as it can combat urban heat island effects and enhance the quality of air, besides offering organic, fertiliser-free produce. The Food and Agricultural Organization has long since recognised urban agriculture as a key element in food security strategies. However, a formal recognition of urban agriculture and its integration into the urban planning process are necessary for it to be successful. In India, urban agriculture is being carried out in many cities including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai under the leadership of the government, private agencies or even individuals. Considering the wave of organic revolution that it can ignite, startups like Pindfresh may go a long way in equipping India to meet its future food demands.

Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.4 percent in March from the previous month, up from an 0.2 percent growth in February, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data published on Wednesday. On a yearly basis, new home prices increased 4.9 percent in March, slowing from February's 5.2 percent increase, partly due to a high base effect as policymakers rushed to impose a flurry of fresh tightening measures in late March last year.  The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes. Fifty-five cities reported higher prices in March, up from February's 44.  "Today's data shows there is still significant upwards price pressure," Yan Yujin, an analyst with Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute said. "It it possible some cities will release more tightening measures." China's property market has soared since 2016, giving a major boost to the economy but also raising concerns about bubbles. Prices have slowly levelled off and even softened in tier-1 cities following government measures to rein in speculative investment. While more than 100 cities have introduced some measures to cool home prices, analysts still expect moderate price appreciation in the country's vast number of smaller centres where regulations are less restrictive. Price gains reported by smaller provincial capitals expanded by 0.3 percentage points in March from that in February. Meanwhile, prices in top-tier cities also increased 0.1 percent in March from February, reversing a fall in the previous month, the NBS said in a statement along with the data. New home prices on average for the country are expected to rise faster than previously thought in 2018 on falling inventories and still robust demand from tier-3 and tier-4 cities, according to a Reuters poll last month. China posted its fastest property investment growth in three years in the first quarter, driven by a surge in land values and as developers grew more confident about the policy outlook, even as sales slowed and existing curbs hit transactions. New household loans, mainly mortgages, totalled 580 billion yuan in March. They made up 52 percent of total new yuan loans, versus 33 percent in February. Chinese property developers are also reporting firm results. Last week, China's second-largest property developer Vanke reported total contract sales of 154.26 billion yuan in the first quarter, up from 150.3 billion made in the same period last year. Higher borrowing costs pose a risk for the sector as they will potentially dampen demand, although mortgage rates remain low compared with historic levels, analysts say.

The first lady superstar of Bollywood passed away due to accidental drowning in the bathtub.  Many Bollywood celebrities attended the last rites of Sridevi but Kareena Kapoor Khan was absent during that time as she was in Rajasthan with son Taimur Ali Khan and husband Saif Ali Khan who was shooting there for his upcoming movie.  A few days after the funeral, Kareena did visit Sridevi's residence to meet Boney Kapoor and offer her condolences.  At a leading daily's conclave recently, Kareena appeared along with sister Karisma Kapoor and the siblings spoke about their grief and fondness for the late actor. In earlier interviews, Kareena has always gushed about her love for Sridevi and in return, Sridevi has been an ardent supporter of Kareena's work.  "I have watched Khuda Gawah in the theatre eight times. It's our favourite ," Kareena fondly remembered.  On the other hand, Karisma said, "We were grief-stricken. We have idealised this woman for so many decades. Stardom can be here today and gone tomorrow, and an actor has to realise that." Meanwhile, Sridevi's daughter Janhvi Kapoor recently broke her silence on her mom's demise and penned a heartbreaking message on Instagram. Janhvi said, "On my birthday, the only thing I ask of all of you is that you love your parents. Cherish them and devote yourself to making them feel that love. They have made you. And I ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace. Let the love and adulation you'll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa. And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world. Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were. Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it. Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who's entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love. Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his "Jaan". She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife. She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles. It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love. For people to be good and gracious and kind. She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy."  "So let's be that. Let's be full of only good and give only love. That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something. The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form. That's what she stood for. Dignity, strength and innocence. Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days. It's given us hope and strength and we can't thank you all enough," Janhvi added.

Chatrak (2001) This Bengali film, stars Anubrat Basu and Paoli Dam. The film was struck many controversies for the number of intimate frames. How do the makers of such films think that the movie can be watched with the family? Or maybe the maker doesn’t need people to watch the movie happily.   Cosmic Sex (2014) Having a storyline that revolves around s** and spirituality. The actresses of the film also won ‘best actress award at Osian’s Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema’. Bold one.

The plot of this story is the sexual relationship of novelist Nrbed Lahiri and the character of a women in his book. I don’t understand the moto of the director of such films. Seriously. Don’t they understand how vunerable the minds of little kids towards such obscene films.!  Chhip Suto Char The plot of the movie is the romantic drama that goes around four young girls. Young girls portraying such characters, may actually send wrong kind of message to the society.  Chitrangada: The crowing wish The film tells the story of the people that strive or struggle a lot with their gender identity. The movie has a lot of nudity and obscene frames.  And these were some Bengali movies that are absolutely bold with lot of nudity and obscenity in different frames of the film.  Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 17 Sep, 1.36 pm

Although the letter claims that there was never a hack, latest developments breaking out of Delhi reveal, that the private keys to the offline wallets were leaked online and the hackers siphoned with the BTC leaving no trace of the hack or transfer of Bitcoins.  Coinsecure's letter  Although users of Coinsecure were frustrated, the letter clearly stated that all victims of the hack will be compensated irrespective of the stolen funds being recovered. The police complaint accuses an insider, Dr. Amitabh Saxena as the key perpetrator in the incident.   FIR filed by Coinsecure Delhi Police Cyber Cell has registered a case was under IPC sections and Section 66 of the IT Act. The latest developments reveal that the hacker[s] deleted all the history related to the affected wallets. The missing data logs could have revealed the where the stolen Bitcoin was transferred. This incident occurred just days after the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) issued a statement stating that all RBI regulated entities will not participate in the transactions related to cryptocurrencies. We have reached out to Coinsecure and the Delhi Police Cyber Cell division, there will be more updates soon. "..No one who understands crypto doubts that the U.S. dollar will have zero value in 10 years. Why then not accept a 500% devaluation in 2 and a half years?" "Just to let you know John, you can't have a 500% devaluation. I think you mean 50%, since anything over a 100% devaluation would put you in the negative. Math is hard." "This is the exact reason why I'm buffering my crypto with physical gold and silver. Fiat will be (and in a way already is) worthless. Crypto, precious metals and land all the way!"  "I'm interested in bitcoin as a sort of bubble. It doesn't mean that it will disappear, that it'll burst forever. It may be with us for a while,"   "To me, it's interesting as another example of faddish human behavior. It's glamorous,"   "I understand not understanding the whole ecosystem is not the greatest thing when speaking to a technology in that world, but everyone is dismissing his analysis of Bitcoin on the grounds that he doesn't know what an ICO is? I'm not sure how that counters his analysis of the Bitcoin bubble. In fact, I think he would contend, that dismissing his thoughts on the bubble by saying "he doesn't know what an ICO is lol" strengthens his argument of the psyche of the Bitcoin participant being someone who 'gets it' and any contention simply dismissed as 'not understanding'."   "As an economics major, Shiller was one of my college heroes. His opinion holds weight with me."  Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 13 Jan, 12.04 am

Let's see some unseen facts on the world of Naga Sadhus.   15 Extraordinary and Amazing Powers of the Aghori Sadhus From Black Magic!   1. Origin of Naga Sadhus Origin of Naga Sadhus It is said that the clan emerged more than 2500 years ago. According to Indian storytelling, some 2500 years ago appeared a man who became known as Adi Sankaracharya, India's greatest philosopher, prolific commentator of ancient texts, poet, and for our purpose here, the greatest organizer of the ancient tradition of Yogis, the founder of the monastic order known as Sannyasis. He was the one who brought the concept of Naga Sadhus.    Know the Journey of Becoming an Aghori!   2. Rise of Naga Sadhus Rise of Naga Sadhus About 1500 years later, a number of lineages of Naked Yogis, or Naga Babas from among Shankaracharya's order of Sannyasis, formalized even more ancient bonds into an association called The Akhara.   7 Places in India where Black Magic is Still Practised!   The Akhara's collected lineages look back for their origins to the Age of Treta, countless thousands of years ago, the age of the epic poem, The Ramayan. All the Naga Sadhus still maintain strong ties with the Akharas. 3. Naga Sadhus are Trained Warriors Naga Sadhus are Trained Warriors Naga Sadhus are trained warriors.

Nagas live away from Civilization! Naga Sadhus live a life of anonymity. They do not interact with the general public and live in caves, forests and deep inside the jungles and live a life of hardships and worship the ultimate god, Lord Shiva. They believe that Lord Shiva is the Ultimate God. Their living a life of Austerity and ascetic is a sign of their dedication to their lord. 5. Use of Darogas by Akharas Use of Darogas by Akharas Each 'Akhara' uses a Daroga who acts as an informant and a messenger. This Daroga then roams around the jungles and meet the Naga Sadhus and inform him about the news relating to Akhara. This Daroga also gives the information about the Kumbh Mela to these Sadhus.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news24online-epaper-newsonline/vagina+vagina+vaigina+says+this+angry+bollywood+actress-newsid-80774329| Entertainment News Vagina, Vagina Vaigina, says this angry Bollywood actress |  New Delhi, Jan 29: Sanjay Leela Bhansali's latest film released after witnessing widespread protests all over India. Karni Sena stages massive protest against the release of the movie. Not only this even lead actress Deepika Padukone received threats and a booty of Rs 1 cr was also announced for chopping her ear and nose.   Now Bollywood actress Swara Bhaskar has come out with a hard hitting open letter. The actress wrote that she felt reduced to a vagina after watching the magnum opus of Bhansali.   Swara's letter, written for The Wire, calls the direct Bhansali out for glorifying acts - jauhar and sati - that deprive women of life and liberty. "Women have the right to live despite being raped, sir. Women have the right to live, despite the death of their husbands, male 'protectors', 'owners', 'controllers of their sexuality'.. whatever you understand the men to be," Swara mentioned in her letter.      Swara further writes: "It would be nice if the vaginas are respected; but in the unfortunate case that they are not, a woman can continue to live. She need not be punished with death, because another person disrespected her vagina without her consent."  Padmaavat is based on the legend of Rani Padmini who supposedly committed jauhar to escape the invading emperor Alauddin Khilji. The actress letter includes a hat tip to the difficult circumstances that accompanied the release of "Padmaavat" and noted that she had spoken up for the film while it was fighting for survival.  Meanwhile Swara's friend and co-star Sonam Kapoor retweeted an appreciative comment on the open letter, many online user have not been welcoming enough. This tweet from actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi referencing Swara's acclaimed performance in 2017 film Anaarkali Of Aarah is pretty much sums up the general reaction: "Funny that an actress who can play an erotic dancer/prostitute with such elan should feel like a vagina after watching a story of a pious queen. What standards are these... tch tch." Dailyhunt	|Monday, 29 Jan, 3.38 am4 days ago

The importance of chanting Dattatreya mantra  The problems faced in life due to the curse of ancestors are called as Pitrudosh or Pitru Shaap. Almost every individual born on this earth suffers due to pitrudosh in some form or the other. Pitrus are the souls of the departed ancestors from our families which are struck in the middle world called as Martyaloka and Bhuvarloka. Some of the effects of Pitru dosh include absence of progeny, inability to get married, disharmony in family life, birth of premature babies, etc. Chanting Dattatreya mantra is a sure way to escape the ill-effects of Pitru dosh in our lives.

Dattatreya mantra benefits - The Dattatreya mantra provides a kind of shield around the chanters and protects us from the problems caused by the ancestors. The effects of Pitrudosh and Pitru Shaap gradually decline when chanting this mantra. -Dattatreya mantra can relieve the souls of ancestors that are struck in some heavenly planes and lead them in their journeys to heavens. Since these souls cannot help themselves, we can help them by chanting the mantra on their behalf staying on the earth. -Since Lord Dattatreya is the combined form of Lord Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - the Hindu trinity, this form is a highly powerful one in blessing the devotees with abundance, prosperity and happiness.

Being one of the most important parts of your body, one should have a knowledge about it. And knowing your won is just not enough, you must have an insight into your partner's private parts too if you want to take romance to the next level. Unlike men, lady parts are quite confusing and there is a lot more going on down there. What's more surprising is that women too don't know these 10 things about their private parts. The list will fascinate you and might even boost your sex life.   Attention Ladies! If You Are Facing These Problems, You Might Have Unhealthy Private Parts   1. It is not what you might think it is    Unlike men, a woman's sexual organs are a bit more complex. The exterior part of the female's sexual organs is referred as the vagina but it is not what you think it is. This, in fact, is not called vagina as the outer visible part is composed of the labia, clitoris, urethra and vaginal opening. The vagina is actually just the muscular passageway that connects the vulva to the cervix.  If You Notice These Unusual Symptoms, You Might Have Cervical Cancer  2. Women can give men STD even if they use a condom    We all know that the chances of getting HIV and STDs can be lessened if you take proper safety measures during sex. But men can catch sexually transmitted diseases even if they use a condom. The skin of the vulva can still touch infectious skin of the scrotum and men can catch herpes, molluscum contagious and pubic lice. 3. It's different for every woman    Just like every woman looks different, they have different things down there. The colour, the shape, the smell, everything varies in the lady part of women. However, the function is same. So don't be surprised when it's a bit different from what you see in adult films.   10 Everyday Habits That Cause Great Harm To Your Manhood   4. The hair down there has three functions    We all start growing hair on our private parts when we hit puberty. Though pubic hair might seem unnecessary to us, it actually has three important reasons for its existence. First, it protects the vagina. Second, it sends signals to potential partners that you are biologically ready to procreate. And last but not the least; it helps in attracting opposite sex as it is full of pheromones. 5. The pain during intercourse is quite common    It is actually pretty common for women to experience a certain amount of pain during sexual intercourse. Around 30 % of women have felt pain during the last session of intercourse. A condition, called vulvodynia is responsible for the chronic pain during sex. The pain can be prevented with simple tips like using more lubricants, comfortable make-out positions and many other things.   8 Common Things All Men Do Regularly Which Can Decrease Their Sperm Count   6. The lady part can grow in size when aroused    If you think that only male's part can grow in size when aroused then you are wrong. During arousal, it can expand to around twice as big as its original size, which is three to four inches deep. This process of expanding is called vaginal tenting. When you are aroused, your muscular tension increases in the body which draw the uterus upwards and creates more space in the vagina lengthwise. 7. Women have more sensitivity than men down there    Many people believe that vagina is equal to the male penis; it's just an inverted version. But many anatomical studies found that the clitoris is, in fact, the female version of a penis, since it visibly grows in size when stimulated. The difference is that the clitoris is designed just for pleasure than for reproduction which makes it different from male equivalent.  If You Have These Allergies After Getting Intimate With Your Partner, Then Rush To Doctor Immediately  8. It can come out of your body    Due to weakened pelvic muscles, the rectum, uterus, or bladder pushes on the vagina. This condition is known as vaginal prolapsed. In severe cases, the vagina protrudes out of the body. This condition can usually happen in rare cases after natural childbirth. C-section is better to avoid this condition. 9. It grows with age    Sounds quite shocking, but that's what the truth is. Just like your hair and finger, one of the sexual parts, the clitoris can also grow with time. Throughout a woman's life, it grows in size. By the time a woman reaches menopause the clitoris can be 2.5 times larger than when a woman was a teenager. The growth of clitoris helps a woman have stronger orgasms.   10 Surprising Health Benefits Of Making Love Daily   10. It cleans itself    The fact that vagina cleans itself is lesser known to many women. Using cleansers to clean the vagina cause more harm than good since it throws the pH levels out of balance. There are more bacteria in your mouth than the vagina, so just use water and soap and stay away from everything, because you don't really need them. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 17 Jul, 10.05 pm

It's been less than three years since the Maruti Celerio introduced our country to this technology by becoming the first mainstream product to offer an AMT. Fast forward to 2018 and we already have at least half a dozen popular cars that offer an optional AMT. What's more, there are a handful of cars that about to jump on the AMT bandwagon. Here, in this post, we take a look at 5 upcoming AMT cars in 2018 -  Hyundai Santro AMT  The Indian subsidiary of Hyundai seems to be planning to launch a new entry-level hatchback to replace the Eon. There have been talks that it will be known as the 'new Santro'. While the company is yet to confirm this, it has already said that its upcoming small car will offer an AMT. Prices of the next-gen Santro will likely start around Rs 3 lakh and the new tallboy will become the first-ever Hyundai car in India to come with an AMT.   Tata Nexon Petrol & Diesel AMT     It looks like the launch of the AMT-equipped Nexon is merely days away. There have been talks that the company has already started registering bookings of the upcoming variants. Chances are that the prices of the AMT models will start at Rs 7 lakh. The highlight here is that the AMT option will be available on both Petrol and Diesel engine variants. With this, the Nexon will soon become the only compact-SUV to offer an AMT with both the engine options. The sub-4m SUV will get a 6-speed Automated Manual Transmission that will offer both Creep and Hill Hold features.  Mahindra KUV100 Petrol & Diesel AMT     The second compact SUV to offer an AMT option on both its fuel variants will be the Mahindra KUV100. Expected to launch by the middle of this year, the KUV100 will get a 5-speed AMT unit. Its prices are likely to start below Rs 5 lakh. With its launch, the KUV100 AMT will become the most affordable car in Mahindra's lineup to offer an automatic gearshift technology. It may be noted here that the KUV100 has pretty much failed to garner a positive response from the market. The new AMT variants, however, should inject at least some appeal into the slow-selling crossover.  Ford Figo AMT     Ford's new 1.2-litre, three-cylinder petrol engine from the Dragon series of motors made its debut on the Figo-based Freestyle crossover. However, this engine will also make it to the upcoming Figo facelift. The new engine outputs 95 bhp and 115 Nm, which makes it the most powerful 1.2-litre naturally-aspirated engine in its segment. It will come mated to a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed AMT. Expect the starting price to be under Rs 6 lakh.  Ford Aspire AMT     Of course, the new engine and the AMT will even make it to the updated Figo-based Aspire compact sedan. The Aspire facelift will feature the same 1.2-litre Dragon-series motor and the same 5-speed AMT. However, it's likely to offer a beige-black colour theme for the cabin along with a few more features. The company is yet to divulge concrete information on the launch date but we expect the new Figo and the new Aspire to hit the market towards the middle of this year. So, which of these upcoming AMT cars in 2018 are you waiting for? Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 01 Mar, 3.46 pm4 weeks agoa month ago3 weeks ago2 days ago4 weeks ago

PPF for NRIs: NRIs are not allowed to open a PPF account. But, a resident Indian who turns an NRI during the tenure of the account can continue to avail its benefits till maturity. But the NRI cannot extend the account for a block of five years.  NSC for NRIs: NRIs cannot invest in NSCs. However, a resident Indian who turns NRI during the tenure of the instrument is eligible to avail the benefits till maturity of the certificate on a non-repatriation basis. However, amendment to the rules governing NSC and PPF for NRIs has made a major change to the old regulations.  What does the  2017 Amendment Rule says?   PPF for NRIs: The new notification says that "if a resident who opened an account under this scheme, subsequently becomes a non Resident during the currency of the maturity period, the account shall be deemed to be closed with effect from the day he becomes a non-resident..."  In short, as per the new amendment rule, NRIs cannot avail the benefits of PPF till maturity. The account will be closed as soon as his status changes from Resident Indian to NRI.  NSC for NRIs:The new notification says, "Provided that if a resident who purchased the certificate, subsequently becomes a non Resident during the currency of the maturity period, the certificate shall be encashed or deemed to be encashed on the day he becomes a non-Resident..."  For NSCs as well, NRIs will not be able to avail the benefits till maturity of the certificate. It will cease to exist once his status changes from Resident Indian to NRI.  What About Interest?  The notification says that for both PPF and NSC for NRIs "interest shall be paid at the rate applicable to the Post Office Saving Account, from time to time, from such day and up to the last day of the month preceding the month in which it is actually closed/encashed."  Let us understand this with an example:  Mr 'A' holds an NSC or PPF account. But he turns NRI on October 31, 2017. Both NSC and PPF will cease to exist. Let us assume that Post Office Savings Account interest rate for the month of September was 3%. Then his NSC and PPF will earn 3% interest from October 31, 2017. Earlier, the change in status did not affect NSC or PPF for NRIs as they were able to avail the benefit till maturity. NSC will be encashed on the day the holder becomes an NRI, while PPF account will be closed if the account holder changes his resident status. This new amendment would not allow NRIs to make investment for retirement and secure their future as both NSC and PPF will cease to exist once their status change from Resident Indians to NRIs. It would be wise to withdraw their corpus in these schemes and put them in better returning instruments. Since April 2016, the interest rates of small saving schemes were recalibrating on a quarterly basis, except the Oct-Dec quarter of this year. The interest rate for both PPF and NSC schemes is pegged at 7.8% interest for October-December 2017. Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 18 Nov, 2.03 am

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm3 months ago4 days ago2 months ago

Why Do People Buy Gold on Akshaya Tritiya? |  Akshaya Tritiya is an auspicious day for Hindus and Jains around the world. It is also known as Akti in Chhattisgarh and Akha Teej in Gujarat and Rajasthan. It falls on the 3rd tithi (lunar day) of the Bright Half (Shukla Paksha) of the month of Vaisakha. Hindus consider Akshaya Tritiya as one of the luckiest days because of the planetary position of Sun and Moon. Akshaya translates to 'eternal' or 'never diminishing' in Sanskrit. For Lord Vishnu, people keep fast on this day. Whole day people pray to god for their children's happiness and health.

Another legend says that, Lord Ganesha and Veda Vyas started writing Mahabharata. Also peoples do pooja of Lord Kuber, worship Lord Shiva and in return get wealth on the same day.People who observe the long year alternative day fasting known as Varshi-tap finish their 'Tapasya' by doing parana and drinking sugarcane juice. It is also belived that the God of Wealth and the treasurer of all deities 'Kubera' received his riches and position by praying to Lord Shiva at Shivapuram on Akshaya Tritiya. The day is considered auspicious to start new ventures and buy gold or property. Buying gold on Akshaya Tritiya is believed to invite endless fortune. No wonder the jewellery stores, whether brick and mortar or online, see a huge number of buyers. During Akshaya Tritiya, rice, ghee, fruits, clothes, tamarind, vegetables, and salt are given as charity. This year Akshaya Tritiya falls on April 28th and is considered auspicious because of its conjunction with Rohini Nakshatra. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 28 Apr, 1.05 am

Lemos, 37, along with his senior accounts specialist, Ryan de Souza, 25, were convicted of duping thousands of investors in a Ponzi scheme that offered investors annual returns of 120 percent on a minimum investment of $25,000 through his company Exential. Initially, the company paid profits but stopped paying its investors after the scheme collapsed in March 2016 and the company's offices were shut down by the Dubai Economic Department in July 2016.  Lemos's wife Valany Cardozo said that she has still not given up hope, despite the 500 year sentence.  "The only reason he got convicted is because of the number of complaints (513 cases) filed against him," Cardozo said. Cardozo also denied the allegations that they ran a Ponzi scheme, and said that they encountered a problem due to the closure of one of their bank accounts.  "It was a genuine problem and my husband promised to solve it. But the team leader in the company together with our competitors and some lawyers got together and brainwashed clients. They filed complaints and this kept escalating," claimed Cardozo. A case has also been registered against Cardozo, for illegally entering the sealed office in December 2017 and taking out documents. Lemon gained prominence in 2015 when his company FC Prime Markets became the principal sponsor of FC Goa, the Goan franchise in the Indian Super League of domestic football. He got easy access to famous personalities through his association with the league, including with Sachin Tendulkar, Abhishek Bachchan and Ranbir Kapoor and even international football icons such as Ronaldinho.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/thehansindia-epaper-hans/only+hcs+can+hear+appeals+in+cheque+bounce+cases-newsid-75684572| Latest News Only HCs can hear appeals in cheque bounce cases |  In a significant judgment, the High Court at Hyderabad has held that the complainant in cheque bounce case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881 does not come under the ambit of a 'victim' under  Section 2(wa) of the Criminal Procedure Code. It also ruled that in such cases appeals against verdicts given by trial courts lie only with the High Court.  The division bench comprising of Justice P V Sanjay Kumar and Justice Shameem Akhter delivered this judgment recently while disposing of the petition filed by a woman Vijayalakshmi seeking quashing of a Criminal Appeal filed under Sec 372 of CrPC by her opponent before Metropolitan Sessions Judge (MSJ) court.  The appeal was filed questioning the order of the Special Magistrate (trial court) acquitting Vijayalakshmi in February 2016. Vijayalakshmi contended before the High Court that if there was any objection to the trial court judgment, the only option was to file an appeal under Sec 378(4) of CrPC in the High Court after taking its leave.  The learned single judge who heard this case found that there was divergence of opinion on questions of law and referred it to the division bench seeking an authoritative pronouncement on the issue.  The division bench settled the issue by its pronouncement that a complainant in a cheque bounce case for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881 does not come under the ambit of a 'victim' under Section 2(wa) of the Criminal Procedure Code and that Appeals in such cases lie only with the High Court and not MSJ courts.

Rashi Khanna is having a great time at the box-office. Though her recent film with Ravi Teja 'Touch Chesi Chudu' bombed at the box office, her 'Tholiprema' with Varun Tej is rocking at the box office. The film went on to collect a staggering Rs 40 crores at the box office. This is the second highest collection for a Varun Tej film.   With star heroines like Anushka, Samantha, Kajal Agarwal turning seniors, the directors are in the hunt for the next generation. Given the diverse stories, and the characterization, skin show alone cannot come to the rescue of the heroines. They need to act and dance well too.    In fact, Rashi Khanna was called for the screen test for Sukumar's Rangasthalam. The actress did not make it to the final cut. According to close sources, Rashi Khanna is being considered as the heroine alongside Ram Charan, in SS Rajamouli film.   Rashi Khanna did share screen space with Jr NTR in Jai Lava Kusa. Keeping this in mind, Rajamouli planning to rope in the actress alongside Ram Charan this time. Only time can tell, whether Rashi Khanna is really that lucky or not!

Well, the movie is definitely providing a never-seen-before cinematic experience to the viewers, but here are few more things which you would definitely love to see.

Deepika too admitted that it was one of the most difficult sequences she has ever performed.      Image Source  History remembers the Queen for the Jauhar act that she committed to save her dignity. Take a look at the original pictures where (it is believed) Rani Padmini committed Jauhar. Also, the story behind it will haunt you. As per a leading news portal, Rani Padmini was well trained. "Rani Padmini was well-trained in war strategies and battleship. This made her adept at the art of swordsmanship."

Image Source  "Many princes and kings lost to her and it was only king Rawal Ratan Singh who won and she had to marry him." When Alauddin saw Rani Padmini's reflection in the mirror.

He only saw Padmini in a reflection as she didn't allow him to see her face to face."     Image Source  Alauddin captured Raja Ratan Singh. "Alauddin deceitfully captured Ratan Singh. This led to the women of Chittor prepare for Jauhar while the fight was still going on. As many soldiers of Chittor's army died, Ratan Singh also died while fighting beside his men."     Image Source      Image Source  Rani Padmini was the first who jumped in the Jauhar Kund. "The women walked down a secret passage within the fort that led to the Jauhar Kund. Padmini was the first to jump in the Jauhar Kund while other women followed."     Image Source      Image Source  "Their cries and wailings were so loud that Alauddin ordered the passage to be closed permanently and it was reopened only after many years by the king of Chittor to honour the brave women."

Vu is also an old player in India that offers smart TVs at very affordable prices. So, here is a comparison of 32-inch smart TVs from all the three manufacturers. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Price in India The 32-inch Xiaomi Mi TV 4A was launched in India on 7th March 2018, and it costs Rs. 13,999, making it one of the most affordable smart HD TVs in India. The 32-inch Thomson LED Smart TV was launched in India yesterday, and it costs Rs. 13,490. The 32-inch Vu LED Smart TV is the costliest TV among all with a price tag of Rs. 15,999. The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A, as well as the Thomson Smart TV, are sold through online flash sales. The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A can be bought from Mi Store and Flipkart, whereas the Thomson Smart TV is currently being sold only through Flipkart. The next flash sale for the Mi TV 4A is set for 12 PM on 17th April 2018, whereas the next flash sale of the Thomson Smart TV is set to take place at 12 PM on 18th April 2018. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Display All the three TVs feature a 32-inch LED display with HD resolution (1366 x 768 resolution) and 60Hz refresh rate. All the three TVs also have a viewing angle of 178 degrees. The Thomson Smart TV and Vu Smart TV are rated for 450 nits of brightness, whereas Xiaomi hasn't provided max brightness figure. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Features The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A is powered by a quad-core Amlogic processor mated with 1GB of RAM. The TV also has 8GB of internal storage. The Mi TV 4A runs on a heavily customised version of the Android operating system, and it features Patchwall. The Patchwall merges content from all the media-streaming applications and set-top boxes in one pane. The Patchwall makes navigating and searching through the content easy. The Mi TV 4A also comes with an easy to use 12-button remote. The remote works on Bluetooth. Hence, the user doesn't need to direct the remote towards the TV for proper operation. The Thomson LED Smart TV features a 64-bit processor, 1GB of RAM, and 8GB of internal storage. The TV runs on a customised version of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. The TV comes pre-loaded with a bunch of media-streaming apps like YouTube and Netflix. There is also an app store built into the TV, from where the users can download apps. The Thomson LED Smart TV supports Miracast for mirroring content from the smartphone to the TV. The Vu LED Smart TV runs on the Android operating system, and Vu calls it as PremiumSmart OS. Vu hasn't revealed the make and model of the processor used in the TV. The TV comes pre-loaded with Netflix and YouTube. There is also an app store from where the users can download the available applications and games. The bundled remote comes with dedicated Netflix and YouTube button. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Connectivity The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A has three HDMI ports, one AV input, two USB 2.0 ports, one 3.5mm audio out, and one Ethernet port. The Vu Smart LED TV also has the same connectivity options. The Thomson LED Smart TV also features three HDMI ports, two USB 2.0 ports, one 3.5mm audio jack, and one ethernet port, but it misses out on AV input. As for the wireless connectivity, all the three TVs have Wi-Fi b/g/n, but only the Mi TV 4A comes with Bluetooth connectivity option. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Verdict From hardware specifications perspective, there isn't much difference between the three TVs; they have same spec display panels, same speaker output wattage, and almost similar connectivity options. However, the Mi TV 4A is a step further than the other two TVs with its Bluetooth connectivity and Patchwall feature. We think that going with the Mi TV 4A would be a wise choice.

Well, it actually happens in real life. But did you ever thought that is this practised?     image source  Well, this custom has been followed since the time of British Raj. And there are various reasons attached to it.  Breaking the nib of the pen is a symbolic act which means that the pen with which someone's death was written will never be used again to do that ever again.     image source  Passing death sentence is the last resort action taken in some really extreme cases in which any other punishment won't do justice to the crime. Moreover, after giving the death sentence, the judges have no right to revoke their own decision. Therefore, the nib is broken so that judges can;t have a second thought of reviewing their judgement once again. And thirdly, it might be practised as a way of distancing himself/herself from the judgement and the guilt of the same. Well, we never knew about this!

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/what+it+means+if+a+lizard+falls+on+you-newsid-71506616| Home What it means if a lizard falls on you? | Ideally, you scream at the top of your lungs and run for your life. It is only later that the gravity of the situation dawns on you and you feel creepy all over. For those of you who fear lizards, our sympathies. In fact, there are people who will not venture into a room if they see a lizard in it (raises hand in admission). Though they are harmless (I find that difficult to believe) household pests, they have a lot of bad press attached to them. Also, they make good subject for superstitions as well. Apparently, if the poor lizard happens to fall on you it's trying to tell you something (how about the lizard just lost its balance?). Did you know a lizard falling on certain body parts mean certain things? It only goes to show these reptiles are not very good with staying on the ceilings.  Heck, whatever a lizard does has some meaning!  Scouring through the database of all things weird this is what we came up with  #The study of falling of lizards is called Gauli shastra. According to this shastra, every movement of a lizard holds significance and there are not less than 65 places where the lizard will fall on the human body that would foretell good and bad omens. #If you happen to see two lizards mating it means you are going to meet an old friend, if you seem them quarrelling you will also pick fight with someone. #If you see a dead lizard while moving into a new house, it could mean bad luck and illness for your family. On the contrary, some people believe seeing a lizard in the new house means Goddess Lakshmi is visiting them. #The lizard must know on which side to fall: Lizard falling on your right arm means elevation in society or a sensual adventure ahead and on your left arm means you are going to lose money. It is considered auspicious if the lizard falls on the right body parts of man and left body parts in women. For both it means different things. #The most common one, in the north if a lizard falls on your head it means good luck and if it falls on your forehead it means you will have a disease while some say it brings wealth. In the south people believe that if a lizard falls on the head then it means ill luck and in some cases even death. For example there is a story that a lizard fell on Chief Minister Biju Patnaik, just before elections in 2009, and he came back to power.​ #The lizard on the right and left shoulders mean victory and peace and happiness respectively. #If the thing decides to take a tour of your body, well, it seems it is wishing you a long life. #It is difficult to term what noise a lizard makes- is it twittering, is it chirping, or is it clucking? Anyway, so what does it mean when you hear a lizard's call? I would say it's just conversing with its mates but then humans also have an explanation for that as well. In Malayalam movies at least, if a lizard calls when you are saying something then it means that you are telling the truth and that is bound to happen. #To wash off all the ill luck that comes from touching a lizard or it falling on a person, one needs to visit Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram, where one can touch the golden Lizard, the silver lizard along with the sun and moon images on the roof, behind the sanctum sanctorum. When one touches them it is believed to remove all ill-effects or doshas caused due to the falling of lizards in the past and in future.  While we do not endorse any of these and do not wish lizards to fall on you, there are actually mentions of the lizard and its calls and more on its significance in Hinduism, Vedas and South Indian holy scriptures.

The facelifted model of the TUV will be inspired by the Mahindra Stinger Concept, first shown at the 2018 Auto Expo. Here is our speculative render that shows what the facelifted TUV300 would look like.  As seen in the render, the facelifted TUV300 gets the headlamp and grille design of the Stinger. The front bumper is another new item giving the TUV300 fresher looks. Even the tail lamps and rear bumper are likely to see mild changes.  Apart from these changes, the profile of the facelifted vehicle is expected to look similar to the present version. The TUV300 competes with the Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Ford EcoSport and the Tata Nexon. However, it's a lot more rugged as it uses a ladder frame chassis. It is rear wheel driven, making it unique among sub-4 meter compact SUVs sold in India, which generally use a front wheel drive layout.  The TUV300 features a 1.5 liter, 3 cylinder diesel engine that has a twin scroll turbocharger. The engine is rated at 100 Bhp-240 Nm, making it more powerful than most other diesel engines offered by competition. But you must also remember that the TUV300's diesel engine needs to pull much more weight due to the ladder frame chassis of the vehicle. On the current TUV300, Mahindra offers two gearbox options - a 5 speed manual and a 5 speed AMT. These gearboxes are expected to be carried over to the facelifted version as well. The facelifted version is also expected to gain features on the inside, especially in the infotainment section. We expect the facelifted model to feature a touchscreen infotainment unit with Smartphone connectivity options such as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The facelifted TUV300 is expected to be launched in India by the end of this year, with prices starting well below Rs. 7.5 lakhs.

The victim, who was a Class IX student, was brutally raped and murdered on Tuesday, like in the Nirbhaya case in Delhi. The accused even recorded a video of the barbaric act. According to latest reports, four of the accused have been arrested and the police are on their way to nab the other two. The SP has also been accused of not booking a case on the day the tragic incident occurred. A minor boy named Deepak, from the victim's school, has allegedly been harassing her for some time. The girl was on her way to the school with her cousin, when accused came on a two-wheeler and forcibly took her on his bike, which was followed by an autorickshaw which had five other men.  The cousin sister is said to have witnessed the incident and is in a state of shock. Reports claim the accused later showed the video of the rape to her and threatened her against revealing their names and identity. But the sister informed the family members and the victim was rushed to a hospital, but she died on the way. Two of the accused have been identified as minor boys and their photos are making the rounds in the news. The family of the victim kept her body in front of DC's office in Ambedkar Circle on Tuesday night and staged a night-long protest. CM Siddaramaiah was criticised for not visiting the spot, even though he was in the next district. However, even those who were speaking out for Paresh Mesta, especially the political leaders who made a hue and cry about the murder, were not seen raising their voice about this Nirbhaya-like incident.

Omkar Kulkarni, Head of R&D department, Netsurf Network and Austin, Head - Research and Development, Cholayil Private Limited, lists some tips. * An earthy touch: A dip in the pool can beat the summer heat but it can leave a severe tan on the skin for months. Try a mixture of Multani Mitti (mineral-rich clay) along with few drops of lemon and rose water. After your time in the sun, mix the ingredients and apply on exposed areas. The paste calms the skin with a cooling effect. Also apply coconut or olive oil liberally over body parts that are exposed to chlorinated water.  * Spice up your life: Water in swimming pools contains disinfectants like iodide and chlorine, which cause skin problems like acne flare-ups, rashes and red patches. Cinnamon has great anti-microbial properties. Add a few drops of honey and Aloe Vera gel to cinnamon powder to fight bacteria-causing acne. The mixture also keeps the skin moist. * For a golden glow: Turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and cleanses pores from within. Grind neem leaves with water and mix it with one tablespoon of turmeric powder. Apply the paste on the face with few drops of rose water to clear up skin after acne break-outs and also to reduce scars naturally. * The secret mantra: To avoid the contagious skin diseases and allergies caused by swimming in public pools, Ayurveda recommends adding neem leaf extract to bathing water. If you cannot organise a fresh extract every day, pick body cleansing products that have "neem" or "tea tree oil" as their main ingredient.

But our industry is also full of many so called actors who leave no chance to create a controversy and publicity stunts. And one such actor is Rakhi Sawant, the controversial queen of Bollywood. She always tries to remain in the headlines by giving bold statements on various actors of Bollywood. Her latest target is Sunny Leone on whom she has given a number of statements. May be it is Rakhi's insecurity that makes her give nonsense and bold statements against Sunny Leone.   Let's check out some of the statements given by her and I am sure you'll die of laughing on her stupidity.  "I Am A Virgin Like Salman Khan!" 10 Ridiculous Statements Made By 'Controversy Queen' Rakhi Sawant    On the comment of Salman's virginity     In 2013, during the show 'Koffee with Karan' Salman Khan said that he is virgin. Rakhi Swant gave her reaction towards Salman's this comment and said, "I am virgin too. My father has always told me to do anything in life but not sex. I'll have sex with my partner once I get marry".  On her breast implant surgery     When Rakhi Sawant was questioned about her breast implant surgery in the show 'Koffee with Karan' in 2007, she said, "What God Doesn't give, a doctor can give you that."  During the launch of her musical album 'Jaan Bigdela'     In 2015, during the launch of her musical album 'Jaan Bigdela', Rakhi Sawant got angry when media asked her questions about Sunny Leone. She said, "Are you talking about Sunny Leone? We Indians are doing a favor on her. We are giving her money to wear clothes. And this is same as a social work."  On her comparison with Sunny Leone     In 2015 when Rakhi Sawant was compared to Sunny Leone she said "Please don't compare me with Sunny Leone. Whatever that I have achieved in my life is through dance, performance, reality shows and by winning hearts of Indians. I haven't got these things by doing porn movies."  When she compared herself to international stars     On her comparison with Sunny Leone she added this. "I am very glamorous; you can compare me with international stars like Jennifer Lopez and Madonna."  On Salman's comment when he said 'he feel like a raped woman'     During the promotion of 'Sultan' when Salman Khan said that he feels like a raped woman after coming out of the ring, Rakhi gave her opinion when asked. She said, "I don't think that Salman said this. He has only done lip movements, and somebody else has done dubbing of the said comments."  On the death of Pratyusha Banarjee     This year in April, famous TV actress Pratyusha Banarjee committed suicide by hanging herself through a ceiling fan. During a press conference Rakhi Sawant commented over Pratyusha's death and said, "PM Modi should ban the ceiling fans in the country as women of our country are committing suicides by hanging themselves through ceiling fans."  On Aamir's support to Sunny Leone     During many interviews, when Sunny Leone was asked vulgar and disrespecting question, she answered to every question with confidence. On this, Aamir Khan supported her and said that he wants to work with her. When Rakhi Sawant was asked to give her opinion over Aamir's comment she said, "What? Aamir Khan is Supporting Sunny Leone? Listen, I have good news for all of you. I am soon going to be a porn star."  Threatened Sunny Leone to leave India     During a press conference in 2015 Rakhi Sawant threatened Sunny Leone to leave India. She said, "Sunny Leone, you should leave my country right now. Go away from my industry. I have come to challenge you here."  On Katrina Kaif's 'Chikni Chameli'     When 'Chikni Chameli' got very popular in 2012, Rakhi commented over Katrina and said, "I think Chikni Chameli is a nice song. Katrina has performed well in it but there is nothing new in it. I have already done all these dance moves in my songs."  On Sunny Leone's entry in Bigg Boss     When Sunny Leone participated in Bigg Boss-5, Rakhi Sawant said, "How is this possible? People like vulgarity very much. I think people will get to know this next year and after all it's better to be late than never arrive. If people will reject nudity on Indian TV, then I'll be very happy about it."  On Sunny Leone as a lead actress in Jism-2     When Mahesh Bhatt signed Sunny Leone for his movie Jism 2 during Bigg Boss, Rakhi Sawant said, "Mahesh Bhatt is signing her just for nudity in Jism 2. Bhatt make the actresses take their clothes off in the film and Sunny Leone is already a master in it which will make his work easier."  Marriage Proposal for Baba Ramdev     Rakhi didn't even spare Baba Ramdev and offered a marriage proposal to him. In 2011 she said, "I have no problem in marrying Baba Ramdev. I find him very hot and sexy. Once I'll get married to him, his eye will stop pulsating."  When she targeted Kangana Ranaut directly    During the promotion of 'Tanu Weds Manu' in 2011, when Kangana Ranaut was asked to give her opinion about Rakhi and Mika's kiss controversy, Kangana said that she is not Rakhi Sawant who will do such acts. Rakhi found Kangana's comment very offensive and said, "How dare Kangana made this statement to gather publicity. If Kangana is so desperate for publicity the she should kiss Mika Singh for her songs. Why did she use my name for her own benefit?"  On Vidhya Balan's 'Dirty Picture'     Rakhi Sawant made a statement after the release of movie Dirty Picture in 2011. She said, "This movie is based on the life of an item girl and I should have got the role. Although she has worked really good in the movie but I could have performed much better than her."

Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown.

KKR though got criticized for using their RTM card on one of their spinners.  Piyush Chawla    KKR used their card for Piyush Chawla and no one could understand why. Just so that you know, Chawla was the first name in the category for spinners. He had a four-way bid with Chennai, Mumbai, Rajasthan all bidding for him after he set his base price at Rs 1 Cr.There was an intense bidding war for the former KKR player. However, he was eventually bought by CSK for Rs 4.2 crores but KKR used the RTM card to retain the player.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Apparently, Sai Prasad will be assuming his new assignment from Wednesday, 13th December 2017 in place of Ashok Namboodiri who left recently. The assignment in Star Suvarnawill be real challenge for Sai Prasad as he has to pull the channel up against stiff competition from Colors Super, Udaya TV, Zee Kannada and the giant Colors Kannada. It may be noted that Viacom18's second GEC Colors Super has overtaken Star Suvarna after it started airing the new season of Bigg Boss Kannada.     Sai Prasad, who left Star Maa in April 2016 after Star India's acquisition, was on a sabbatical. Recently he was likely to join the GEC Venture of V6 News Group. However it seems he landed up in a better assignment as Star India has identified his potential and approached him in the mean time. Sai Prasad joined Maa TV in 2007 and he went on to grow along with the channel. He gained the confidence of the new management on Maa TV, led by Matrix Lab's Nimmagadda Prasad, and gained prominence and became a Senior Management Member until it was acquired by Star India in early 2016. Before joining Maa TV, he was working for Radio City as Station Head for Hyderabad. He is a Mass Communication Student and started off his career in All India Radio (AIR).

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/maruti+baleno+vitara+brezza+waiting+periods+now+greatly+reduced-newsid-80785845| CarToq Maruti Baleno & Vitara Brezza: Waiting periods now GREATLY reduced | The waiting periods for ultra popular Maruti cars such as the Baleno premium hatchback and the Vitara Brezza sub-4 meter compact SUV have now reduced due to increased outputs at Maruti Suzuki's various factories. The company's Hansalpur factory in Gujarat now produces 1.5 lakh units of the Baleno, and this has helped Maruti bring down waiting periods of the car from 6 to 8 months to just 8-10 weeks. Manufacturing the Baleno at Gujarat has freed up some capacity at Maruti's Manesar and Gurgaon factories at Haryana. This has reduced waiting periods of the Vitara Brezza to 8-10 weeks.   RS Kalsi, Maruti Suzuki's Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales), confirmed these developments with the following statement,   Currently it [the Gujarat factory] is in full swing in A and B shifts and in 2018-19 it will give us full production across the year. So, that would be 2.5 lakh units. This financial year we will receive 1.5 lakh units because the second shift operations [at the Gujarat plant] started only in October. At one point of time, Baleno used to have a waiting period of around 6-8 months. Now it has come down to about 8- 10 weeks. So to that it extent it has helped us. Similarly, Brezza has also come down to 8-10 weeks now There was certain element of discomfort that we are making our customers wait for such a long time for our products. So, from that point of view, the discomfort factor that we faced earlier now isn't there.  The Baleno's chief rival is the Hyundai Elite i20,a car that's available with minimal waiting period. Similarly, the Vitara Brezza's competition - the Ford EcoSport and Tata Nexon - are also available with much shorter waiting periods. This was putting pressure on Maruti to reduce waiting periods as customers unwilling to wait for long have ready options from the competition. With Maruti ramping up production, both the Vitara Brezza and Baleno are expected to enjoy even more success. The Brezza is expected to soon get a petrol engine to attract buyers seeking a petrol SUV. The Baleno isn't likely to see any facelift or feature addition at least for a year more.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

As Bizzare as it may sound but a boy in Florida accidently impregnated 16 girls when they were having a party. While the nation is in a deep shock to learn this incident, it is being widely reported by the media all over the world. The boy is a 15-year-old African American resident of Florida.    Meeting During the Party of a Friend   Meeting During the Party of a Friend All the students are of school going age. They decided to throw a surprise party for their mutual friend, Daliah Jennings. Darla Jennings was surprised at the party which was thrown for her birthday. The birthday party had food and soft drinks but the special attraction was a pool party. The pool was where all the action began!     How did they Get Pregnant?   How did they Get Pregnant? The 15-year-old boy did not have any physical relations with any of the girls present at the party. The boy only once ejaculated into the pool and that did all the things. Most of the girls were in the pool at that time when the boy ejaculated. As weird as it may sound, but the boy's sperm is 1000 times more potent than an average human sperm.    The Boy's Sperm is 1000 times more Potent: Scientists   The Boy's Sperm is 1000 times more Potent Scientists Dr. John Suzukima from Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Hospital has given the reason for this bizarre happening:- "Clinical tests have proven that people who suffer from spermafortis have sperm counts close to a thousand times more potent and rich in spermatozoids than the average man. This kind of semen is fairly similar to that of common water mammals, such as dolphins, manatees and seals and has properties that make it incredibly resistant to water. This condition could definitely explain what happened in this case but clinical trials and further tests would be needed to prove this theory."    The Boy had no Idea about his Condition   The Boy had no Idea about his Condition The 15-year-old young guy claimed that he didn't get physically involved with anyone in the party and he just ejaculated in the pool by mistake. This is what he had to say about the incident, "Some people in town say we had some kind of wild s*x orgy going on and that's how I got all those girls pregnant, but I'm proud to say that I am still a virgin and that if anyone doesn't believe me, I'm ready to undergo medical examination to prove it if that's what it takes."    Birthday Girl Escaped Pregnancy   Birthday Girl Escaped Pregnancy The birthday girl, Daliah Jennings for whom the party was thrown is very happy that she escaped pregnancy. In her words, "I'm glad I didn't have my swimsuit that day. It was a surprise party to celebrate my 15th birthday, let's just say that a baby in my womb is the kind of present I'm glad I didn't get."    The Fate of Pregnant Girls   The Fate of Pregnant Girls Most of the 16 girls are scheduled to undergo an abortion although two of the impregnated girls' families have reportedly admitted that they have decided to bring the birth to the babies as they are devout Christians and against the taking of an innocent life.                     By the way, many Wesites have published it and claimed it to be fake story. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 16 Oct, 10.49 am

The Obama Foundation announced the names of the inaugural class of Obama Fellows on April 16, 2018. The other fellows include civic leaders from the US, UK, Philippines, Hungary, and South Africa.  According to the website of the foundation, the fellowship program supports outstanding civic innovators from around the world to amplify the impact of their work and to inspire a wave of civic innovation. Additionally, the two-year, non-residential fellowship offers hands-on training, resources, and leadership development to equip the fellows to scale the impact of their work.  Preethi was among the 25 women changemakers selected by the Niti Aayog, MyGov.in and the UN as part of the #WomenTransform initiative. Shortlisted from nearly 1000 entries, these women were credited for havingdone phenomenal work in transforming themselves and the society around them. Preethi Harman and the other fellows will "work with members of the Obama Foundation to gain real-world skills, tools, and experiences that will expand the impact of their work."   Recognising Preethi's work, the foundation said that she is equipping a new movement of female leaders to engage their communities in addressing India's toughest problems. However, Preethi wasn't always this motivated. Speaking to The New Indian Express, she said, "I was all over the place when I started out. Like every other good Indian child, I wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to serve people, but I didn't realise whether I had the calibre or capacity for it. Obviously, I didn't do well." She enrolled in a Mass Communication course and realised that she had found her calling. She went on to complete internships, where she admits that she gained the perspective she needed. Now, Preethi and her team at Change.org, facilitate and help petition starters with campaigning. On record, about 2,000 petitions are registered and started every month, and the numbers have been increasing. "I will be working with a group of civic innovators from around the world to inspire people to get involved in their communities. I can't wait to get started," shared Preethi on Twitter. Navdeep Kang, an Indian-origin man from the US, is also one of the 20 people who have been selected for the Obama fellowship. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 17 Apr, 4.16 pm4 days ago2 days ago2 weeks ago

This Is What Spirits Are Trying To Tell You | You are fast asleep but you suddenly wake up startled and when you look at the watch, it's 4 o'clock. You are not waking up from a nightmare or a bad dream but without any trigger. You feel confused and go back to sleep. If your sleep is breaking at the same time almost every day, then there is something you should know. We all know that there lies the other world which tries to contact with us especially in the night. If you wake up at the same time in the night every day, it indicated that the spirit world is trying to tell you something. If your eyes open between 3-5 am     It may indicate a forthcoming trouble in your life. Some positive energy or cosmic energy is trying to build a communication with you. It is telling you to change yourself with your life goals to save yourself from the future in trouble.  If you are experiencing this almost every night, you must practice meditation and breathing exercises to find out what aspect of your life requires attention. If you are unable to sleep between 11 pm - midnight    Most of the people retire to bed around 9 - 11 pm to wrap up their day and get a goodnight's sleep. But if you are unable to sleep past this time, it means that your life is very stressful and so many unresolved issues are going on in your mind. If this is troubling you, you need to take initiative to about your issues with you closed ones. Also, introspection of your own habits will help you in getting a good sleep at night. If you wake up between 12-2 am    It indicates that there are emotional distress and disappointment in life. You have been betrayed in past by someone you trusted. The cosmos are trying to tell you that the right has arrived for new possibilities. If this is happening with you daily, you should adopt the habit of forgiving people. You should also learn to accept your true self and should stay away from any pretence. If you wake up between 2-3 am    If your sleep is getting disturbed between 2-3 am in the night, it indicated a liver-related problem in future. You also have anger related issues which the cosmos are trying to tell you to have a control over them. To get rid of this problem, you should drink cold water when you wake up, concentrate on your breath (inhaling and exhaling) for 5 minutes, and go back to sleep. If you wake up between 5-7 am    If you wake up and start your day between this time, then this tip is not for you. But if you wake up past these hours and your sleep get disturbed during this time, it indicates that you have confidence issues. The cosmos are asking you to be emotionally and mentally strong. Regular yoga and stretching exercises are best if you don't want to wake up scared and distress at these hours of the morning.

Ashish Vidyarthi? | At least two videos on YouTube showed actor Ashish Vidyarthi as the father of Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love Story's wink sensation Priya Varrier. But is it true? Absolutely not. Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/5+bodyguards+who+ve+become+famous+by+just+walking+behind+celebs-newsid-67809480| Home 5 bodyguards who've become famous by just walking behind celebs | Bodyguards- those big, bulky men are the very definition of an alpha male. They protect, jump in the line of fire and are always present to ward off any enthusiastic fan who tries to get too close to their client, the celebrity. On the surface, it may seem as if being a celebrity bodyguard is all about walking behind the famous star while wearing an impassive and stern face. However, there's more to being a celebrity's bodyguard. They often have to live according to their client's schedule; they have to make a trip halfway across the world on a few days' notice and what's worse, they have to protect their clients from any potential embarrassing situation even if they have little control over it. At this point, it's not hard to imagine why they have a huge fan following.  With this in mind, we've found five celebrity bodyguards who've stolen the limelight from their client's limelight.  Choi Young-jae  South Korean President, Moon Jae-in's bodyguard. Choi Young-jae, is everyone's current heartthrob. It doesn't matter that Choi's job is to safeguard the most important person in South Korea, for the internet he is simply, #bodyguardbae. In fact, some people on the internet believe that the President hired Choi in order to put a pretty face to the government. And it seems to have worked. President Moon's promise of change was largely forgotten the moment the Korean public lay its eyes on the bodyguard. Now, a million hearts are probably broken because Choi is reportedly a married man with two kids,   Shera       Shera is one of the most famous bodyguards in Bollywood at the moment and why shouldn't he be? He is quite successful in protecting Salman Khan from his millions of fans. Shera has worked for Khan for more than 15 years and just recently, this trusted individual doubled up as the human wall for Justin Bieber when he landed in Mumbai.

The Hindi remake rights of Arjun Reddy have now gone to producers Murad Khetani and Ashwin Varde of Cine1 Studios. They are keen on the original director Sandeep Reddy Vanga directing the Hindi remake. But Vanga clearly had other plans for his Telugu masterpiece in Hindi. "I had all but finalized Shahid Kapoor for the Hindi remake of Arjun Reddy. We had met and discussed the character and all the details of how it was to be interpreted for a Hindi audience. But my co-producer had other plans," sighs Vanga.  Three days before the release of Arjun Reddy, Vanga wrote off the remake rights to his associate. "He came to me with an emotional plea, wanting me to put his father's name in the credits as a producer. At that time I was thinking only of somehow releasing the film on time. I had put everything into this film. When we couldn't find a producer for the film my family and I put out own money in to produce Arjun Reddy. However at the last minute I signed a document as per my associate's desire." Resultantly Vanga lost financial control over the remake rights of Arjun Reddy. After going into advanced talks for the Hindi remake with Shahid Kapoor, Vanga has now lost the opportunity to direct Shahid in the Hindi remake. Says Vanga, "I've come to know that the remake rights of Arjun Reddy have been sold to in Hindi and the Hindi remake would star Arjun Kapoor. I am caught in a dilemma, as I've already locked in Shahid for the role." Vanga dismisses talk of Varun Dhawan being approached for the Hindi remake. "I wanted Ranveer Singh. When that didn't work out I approached Shahid Kapoor. We met and discussed the remake at length. Now I've been informed the film will be made with Arjun Kapoor. It's a very embarrassing situation for me. I don't know how I'll face Shahid. I am new to all this. Arjun Reddy was my first film. I don't know how the casting procedure works in the Hindi or Telugu film industry." Although Boney Kapoor has personally met Vanga in Hyderabad, the director is unlikely to direct the Hindi remake of Arjun Reddy. "Mr Boney Kapoor has met me and was very warm and accommodating. But I am not sure it's right for me to direct the film with another actor after I've discussed it with Shahid. In any case I'd wish the project my very best. After all it's my baby." If Sandeep Reddy Vanga does decide to direct Arjun Reddy in Hindi he will have one immediate prerequisite. "Arjun Kapoor will have to lose 20 kgs," says Vanga firmly. Is Arjun 'Reddy' for the challenge? Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 25 Jan, 10.41 ama month agoa month ago

Arun is a native of Thiruvananthapuram but is settled in Mumbai. He has been a resident of Houston, Texas for the last four years.   Divya took to her Facebook page to confirm the news about her second marriage. Besides sharing her wedding photo, she wrote, "Thank you so much for the love, blessings and prayers. My gratitude to everyone who sent us their blessings and good wishes. #love #justmarried #blessed #wedding #gratitude #goodwishes #sreeguruvayurappantemple #sincerely."     Divya, who was one of the shining stars during the late 1990s, has worked with the actors such as Mohanlal, Mammootty and Dileep, and with directors Bharathan, IV Sasi, Sibi Malayil and Lohithadas. She has played the female lead in over 50 movies and has now started a new inning in life.  In 2016, she ended her 14-year-old marriage with Dr Sudhir Shekhar and moved back from the USA to Kochi along with her children Arjun and Meenakshi. According to reports, the actress decided to end the marriage due to Sudhir's extramarital affairs and egoistic nature. Reportedly, Divya's deep interest towards dance and acting hadn't also gone well with Sudhir. The actress opened a dance school in Houston and soon established a successful career as a dance teacher. However, her husband was not happy with Divya's career interests and wanted her to stay at home.  Sudhir allegedly asked Divya to shut down her dance school but she refused to do so. Later, she moved back to Kochi along with her children and slowly resumed her first love dancing. In an earlier interview with a popular Malayalam magazine, she expressed her feelings on her separation with her ex-husband. "I kept telling myself, I will not be weak as I am a sensitive person all my life," she said, adding, "During my separation, I was strong as it would affect a lot of people who care about me. It is this thought that gave me the strength to withstand that split." Divya was trained in Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and Mohiniyattam at a very tender age. She was crowned 'Kalathilakom' at the Kerala school kalolsavam in 1990 and 1991. She has presented a variety of Indian dance and art forms on Doordarshan. She has also performed at various Indian dance festivals and international stages throughout North America, Europe and the Gulf. Later, she started her dance class in the US. Many youngsters joined her dance school, all thanks to her popularity as an actress. She used to turn mythological tales and Biblcal stories into Bharatanatyam.

The girl, who was seen in the 1.7-minute-long video, is believed to be a resident of Bhadrak district. It appears that the male partner has shot their intimate moments, in the know of the girl. So far, no complaint has been registered with police in this regard. The incident will surely give fresh headache to the cops as the police are still investigating similar cases including the sensational case involving a youth and a girl from Chandbali in Bhadrak district. The youth had allegedly uploaded hundreds of sex videos to various pornographic websites.  Few days later, the youth was found dead on the banks of Kuakhai river here. Concerned over the situation, Odisha police had earlier issued advisory to all the district SPs and public to check circulation of such videos on the internet. "An advisory has been given to all the district SPs and police officers to follow a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with cases right from examining the objectionable images and videos that are going viral on social media platforms till filing the cases," DGP RP Sharma had told after inaugurating a cyber forensic division on the premises of the State Forensic Laboratory here in November last year.

Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago

The pool was where all the action began!     How did they Get Pregnant?   How did they Get Pregnant? The 15-year-old boy did not have any physical relations with any of the girls present at the party. The boy only once ejaculated into the pool and that did all the things. Most of the girls were in the pool at that time when the boy ejaculated. As weird as it may sound, but the boy's sperm is 1000 times more potent than an average human sperm.    The Boy's Sperm is 1000 times more Potent: Scientists   The Boy's Sperm is 1000 times more Potent Scientists Dr. John Suzukima from Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Hospital has given the reason for this bizarre happening:- "Clinical tests have proven that people who suffer from spermafortis have sperm counts close to a thousand times more potent and rich in spermatozoids than the average man. This kind of semen is fairly similar to that of common water mammals, such as dolphins, manatees and seals and has properties that make it incredibly resistant to water. This condition could definitely explain what happened in this case but clinical trials and further tests would be needed to prove this theory."    The Boy had no Idea about his Condition   The Boy had no Idea about his Condition The 15-year-old young guy claimed that he didn't get physically involved with anyone in the party and he just ejaculated in the pool by mistake. This is what he had to say about the incident, "Some people in town say we had some kind of wild s*x orgy going on and that's how I got all those girls pregnant, but I'm proud to say that I am still a virgin and that if anyone doesn't believe me, I'm ready to undergo medical examination to prove it if that's what it takes."

In her words, "I'm glad I didn't have my swimsuit that day.

The Fate of Pregnant Girls   The Fate of Pregnant Girls Most of the 16 girls are scheduled to undergo an abortion although two of the impregnated girls' families have reportedly admitted that they have decided to bring the birth to the babies as they are devout Christians and against the taking of an innocent life.

Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/curejoy-epaper-curejoy/5+ways+to+stimulate+your+vagus+nerve-newsid-71488484| Wellness 5 Ways To Stimulate Your Vagus Nerve | The vagus nerve is the longest nerve in the human body. It starts in the brain, circles around our digestive system, and connects to every organ. The vagus nerve is a part of the parasympathetic nervous system and is one of the most important nerves because of the effects it can have on the human body. Nowadays, doctors track the vagal tone of patients who have had a heart attack because of the risk of recurring episodes. Vagal tone is the tone of the vagus nerve and is measured by tracking the heart-rate along with the breathing rate. Higher the vagal tone is, faster the body relaxes after an episode of stress. Lower vagal tone is risky and can cause inflammation, resulting the nerve in underperforming.  When our vagus nerve faces a problem, it can cause brain fog, neurotransmitter imbalance, digestive disorders, and more. Let us see how we can activate our vagus nerve and increase the vagal tone. 1. Meditation    People who meditate have been found to have significantly higher vagal tone as it is associated with increase in positivity. Positive emotions let people increase their social connection. It has also been noted that the chanting of "Om" stimulates the vagus nerve. This is because the term "Om" creates an internal vibration in our throat and stimulates other organs too. This indicates that meditation can help a lot in improving the functioning of our vagus nerve. 2. Body Massage    Massaging several areas in our body can stimulate the vagus nerve effectively. For example, a foot massage or a neck massage stimulates the activities of the vagus nerve. It has been found that a neck massage along the carotid sinus (towards the right of your throat where pulse is checked) can activate the functioning of the vagus nerve to a great extent. 3. Singing, Speaking, And Chanting    Singing makes you feel good, but it does more than that. When you sing loud, at the top of your lungs, the oxytocin secretion increases and the muscles at the back of our throat gets worked out more. This, in turn, activates the vagus nerve. When you sing in unison in a choir group or in an open concert, the HRV and vagus function also increase significantly, thereby activating our vagus nerve. The vagus nerve also gets stimulated and the vagal tone increases when you engage yourself in humming, chanting, hymn singing, and upbeat energy singing. Speaking too makes it possible for increasing our vagal tone as the vocal cords get connected when we speak. 4. Yoga And Deep Breathing    Yoga has always proved have amazing effects on the human body. When you practice yoga, the vagus nerve's activity and your parasympathetic system gets stimulated to a great extent. This is because of the increase in the thalamic GABA levels. An increase in the GABA levels improves your mood and decreases your anxiety. Deep breathing is a great way to relax your body and improve your mood. Deep breathing in certain techniques also helps in activating the vagus nerve in a great way. You can practice yogic breathing or alternate nostril breathing. It can also be done by inhaling deeply, closing the airway while pushing the breath against the inside of your chest, and bearing down with your abdominal muscles, in a way that you are trying to pass the gas. This helps in applying internal pressure from the lungs to the surrounding organs, thereby stimulating the vagus nerve as it is connected to the digestive system, heart, and lungs. 5. Fasting Or Reducing Calorie Intake Therapeutically    As we have seen that the vagus nerve is responsible for digestion, it is important to keep our digestive system healthy. If stress in the body increases, the digestive system may shut itself down and our vagal tone will decrease, resulting in many health problems. So, it is necessary to keep fasting from time to time. In that way, we will help our empty stomach send signals back to the brain that digestion is not necessary and the energy stored in the body can be used for relaxation. Periodic fasting or reduction in calorie intake results in an increase in the high-frequency heart rate variability, and thus increases the vagal tone. We can see that a healthy life full of happiness can be achieved through yoga, deep breathing, meditation, singing, laughing more often, and also, reducing calorie intake, so that our digestive system stays happy. This, in turn, proves that a healthy and happy lifestyle helps us activate our vagus nerve and in also helps it work effectively. Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 09 Aug, 6.45 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/investment+guru+india-epaper-invgur/maruti+swift+2018+vs+baleno+which+one+to+buy-newsid-82412483| TOP STORIES Maruti Swift 2018 vs Baleno: Which One To Buy? | Confused whether you should buy the new Swift 2018 or the Baleno? We have the answer. Maruti Suzuki launched the new Swift in India at the Auto Expo 2018 at a starting price of Rs 4.99 lakh. Maruti's other premium hatchback, the Baleno, starts Rs 37,000 higher, at Rs 5.36 lakh. Both these are not natural rivals as the Baleno is a bigger hatchback. But since prices of some variants of these cars overlap, there is bound to be some confusion when shopping for a premium Maruti hatchback. So, which car car should you buy: Baleno or the Swift 2018? Also, which variant makes the most sense? Read on for the answers.   Understanding the cars  There's a lot in common between the Swift and the Baleno, like the platform on which they ride, the engines, and the features too. But there's still a lot that separates them.  Some major differences:  If, at this point, you have managed to shortlist one of the two cars based on its size, powertrain or ride, then head to the respective car's "Variants Explained" article (link below) to find out which variant you should buy. But if you're still confused whether to buy the Swift or the Baleno, keep reading.  Variants of the Maruti Suzuki Swift 2018 are explained here. Click here for the Baleno's "Variants Explained" story.Swift 2018 vs Baleno: Which One Is More Value For Money?  Well, the answer to that also depends on the money you are willing to spend. In the table below, we have listed down the car and the variant to buy depending on your budget.  PETROL - Swift vs Baleno  Case 1: Budget = Rs 5.5 lakh (on-road)Car to buy: Swift LxiReason: Budget constraint Below are the features the Swift Lxi gets as standard, plus the ones it misses out on:  Case 2: Budget = Rs 6 lakh (on-road)  Car to buy: Swift Lxi with added features  Reason: Swift Lxi & Baleno Sigma fall within the budget. You can buy the Swift Lxi and save Rs 40,000 over the Baleno Sigma. This amount can be used to get basic equipment like a music system, seat covers, floor mats and even the features that the Baleno Sigma gets. Takeaway: There's a difference of around Rs 40,000 between the on-road price of the Swift Lxi and the Baleno Sigma. Front power windows and central locking for the Swift will cost around Rs 10,000 (in total) from Maruti Suzuki. You can get them installed at a lower price from the aftermarket but that would void the standard warranty. Door handles and ORVMs can be painted for around Rs 5,000 and that won't affect the warranty. Our advice: Buy the Swift and get power windows, central locking and music system installed from Maruti Suzuki since these features are a must-have these days. Set aside a maximum budget of Rs 30,000 for this. The range of 2-DIN music system units from Maruti Suzuki starts from Rs 8,288 and there are quite a few options within Rs 20,000. If you spend Rs 30,000 on these you'll still have Rs 10,000 for floor mats and seat covers, which you can buy from the aftermarket as well. Note that you'll have to buy floor mats, seat covers and music system for the Baleno Sigma as well. Even after getting all of the above accessories, you would still have about Rs 15,000 left (budget is Rs 6 lakh) to spend on further kitting up the Swift Lxi.  Case 3: Budget = Rs 6.5 lakh (on-road)  Car to buy: Personalised Swift Lxi  Reason: Both the Swift Vxi and Baleno Delta do not justify the incremental value over their previous variants Takeaway: Clearly, the Baleno Delta is the most feature-loaded car here, at at price of Rs 6.53 lakh on-road. However, our Baleno Variants Explained story reveals that it is not the most value for money variant of the Baleno as the additional features you get over the Baleno Sigma don't justify the corresponding increase in price. Same is the case with the Swift Vxi. The Swift Lxi costs Rs 5.45 lakh on-road so you have about Rs 1 lakh spare that can be spent on the car to personalise it and take it up to the Baleno Delta's level. But even then, you won't be able to get features like auto AC, defogger, rear wiper/washer and rear adjustable headrests. But what you can get is things like alloy wheels, infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, fog lights, front armrest, all basic things like seat covers and floor mats and personalise the interior and exterior with offerings from Maruti Suzuki. So, while you might have to spend some more money on the Baleno for seat covers and other basic accessories, you can have a fairly loaded Swift at that price. Our advice: Those who don't want much flash and feel that they'd be happy to overspend on their car for features like auto AC, defogger and rear wiper and washer can go for the Baleno. Otherwise, go for the Swift and personalise it according to your taste. Here's one example.  Case 4: Budget = Rs 7 lakh (on-road)  Car to buy: Personalised Swift Lxi with added features  Reason: The Swift Zxi and Baleno Zeta, the respective variants over the Swift Vxi and Baleno Delta, are not available at an on-road price of under Rs 7 lakh. Equipping the Baleno Delta with features like touchscreen audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with rear parking camera and alloy wheels -- already a part of our personalised Swift Lxi -- will take the cost over Rs 7 lakh. So it's better to either equip the already personalised Swift Lxi with more equipment or save the money.  Case 5: Budget = Rs 7.5 lakh (on-road)  Car to buy: Baleno Zeta  Reason: The personalised Swift Lxi can't be equipped with most of the features that the Baleno Zeta gets standard. The Baleno Zeta justifies the incremental cost over the personalised Swift Lxi. Takeaway: The Baleno Zeta is not only more feature-rich than the personalised Swift Lxi, it also gets more equipment than the Swift Zxi. More importantly, some of the fitments on the Baleno Zeta like telescopic steering adjustment, auto dimming IRVM, and UV-cut glass can't be fitted onto other cars. So the Baleno Zeta will justify the additional money you'll spend on it over both the personalised Swift Lxi (around Rs 86,000) and the Swift Zxi (around Rs 18,000). Our advice: If you have Rs 7.5 lakh to spend on one of these two hatchbacks, buy the Baleno Zeta.  Case 6 and 7: Budget = Rs 8 lakh and Rs 8.5 lakh (on-road)  Car to buy in both cases: Baleno Zeta with added features  Reason: Incremental cost to buy the Swift Zxi or Baleno Alpha is not worth the extra toppings they get over the Baleno Zeta. Takeaway: The Baleno Zeta is approximately Rs 70,000 cheaper than the Swift Zxi , which gets LED headlamps with DRLs and Smartplay infotainment system with rear parking camera that the Baleno Zeta doesn't get. There are some features that the Baleno Zeta gets and the Swift Zxi doesn't, like auto-dimming IRVM, telescopic steering, UV-cut glass, front armrest and follow-me-home headlamps. The fact is, most of these features can't be fitted into the Swift Zxi while you can have the Smartplay infotainment system with parking camera that the Swift Zxi gets fitted in the Baleno Zeta. The Baleno Alpha gets bi-xenon projector headlamps, LED DRLs, and Smartplay infotainment system with parking camera for an additional amount of around Rs 78,000 over the Baleno Zeta. Our advice: Buy the Baleno Zeta and if you really feel the need to have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in your car, go for MGA's infotainment system that costs Rs 26,990. Add the parking camera to it, which is worth Rs 4,590, from MGA. That will take the cost of the Baleno Zeta to around Rs 7.75 lakh. Use the remaining amount (around Rs 25,000 in case 6 and Rs 75,000 in case 7) to kit up your ride further.  DIESEL - Swift vs Baleno  Case 1: Budget = Rs 7 lakh (on-road)Car to buy: Swift LdiReason: Budget constraint The Swift Ldi gets and misses out on the following features: Takeaway: The Swift's base Ldi variant, which is priced at Rs 5.99 lakh ex-showroom, is Rs 52,000 (approximately) cheaper than the Baleno's base Sigma variant. However, when you factor in the taxes to calculate the on-road price of both these cars in Delhi, the difference between the price jumps to Rs 80,000 (approximately), as road tax for private buyers on cars with ex-showroom price under Rs 6 lakh is 5 per cent and for cars with ex-showroom price over Rs 6 lakh is 8.75 per cent. So, it's only the Swift diesel that is available within Rs 7 lakh (on-road price) in Delhi. Our advice: Buy the Swift Ldi and equip it with all basic things like central locking, power windows and a music system.  Case 2: Budget = Rs 7.5 lakh (on-road)  Car to buy: Swift Ldi with added features  Reason: The Swift Ldi costs significantly less than the Baleno Sigma and the savings can be used to add features that you want in your car Takeaway: There's a difference of around Rs 80,000 between the on-road price of the Swift Ldi and the Baleno Sigma. On top of that, you have around Rs 10,000 in hand if you have a budget of Rs 7.5 lakh. Our advice: Buy the Swift Ldi and get all the basic equipment you need in your car. Here's one example:  Case 3: Budget = Rs 8 lakh (on-road)  Car to buy: Personalised Swift Ldi  Reason: Both the Swift Vdi and Baleno Delta do not justify the incremental value over their previous variants Source Name : www.cardekho.com  Dailyhunt	|Friday, 23 Feb, 5.18 pm2 weeks ago4 days agoyesterdaya week ago3 days ago

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/dailyhunt+examprep-epaper-dexampre/origin+development+of+banking+in+india+part+1-newsid-61584903| ExamPrep How To Origin & Development of Banking in India - Part 1 | Bank is a financial institution that provides banking and other financial services to their customers. Banks play an important role in the economic development of the country. It gives the security to the saving of customers and controls the supply of money & credits. It also helps to encourage public confidence for increasing their saving speedily and efficiently. Globally the story of Banking is common. Banking in India originated in the 18th century. The oldest bank in existence in India is the State Bank of India, a government-owned bank formed in 1806, originally named as Bank of Calcutta. SBI is the largest commercial bank in the country. Progress of Banking in India From very early times India had a system of indigenous banking from which was not similar to the modern banking system. The ancient Hindu Scriptures refer to their existence in the Vedic period. For the past three decades, Indian banking system has several outstanding achievements to its credit. It is no longer confined to only metropolitans or cosmopolitans in India. In fact, Indian banking system has reached even to the remote corners of the country. This is one of the main reasons of Indian's growth process.  The Government regular policy for Indian bank since 1969 has paid rich dividends with the nationalization of 14 major private bank of India. The pre - independence period was largely charecterised by the existence of private bank organized as joint stock companies. Most banks were small and had private shareholding of variety. The journey of Indian Banking system can be separated in three phases. These are  Early phase from 1770 to 1969 Middle phase: Nationalisation of Indian Banks and up to 1991 prior to Indian banking reforms. New phase of Indian Banking system with the advent of Indain financial and banking sector reforms after 1991.  1. Early phase of Indain Banking system:  The Bank of Hindostan was the first bank of India, which was set up in the year 1770. Then the General Bank of India was established in 1786 but failed in 1791. The East India Company established Bank of Calcutta in 1806. Then it was reformed as Bank of Bengal. The East India Company established Bank of Bengal (1809), Bank of Bombay (1840) and Bank of Madras (1843) as Independent units and called it Presidency Banks. Later in 1920 these three banks were merged and formed as Imperial Bank of India which started as private shareholders, mostly performed as European shareholders. In 1865 Allahabad Bank was established first time exclusively by Indians. After that Punjab National Bank Ltd was established in 1894 with its headquarters in Lahore. Between 1906 and 1913 Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Indian Bank and Bank of Mysore were set up. Reserve Bank of India was established in 1935. During the first phase the development was very slow and banks faced multiple failures between 1913 and 1948. To make banking function and activities organized, the Government of India came up with the Banking companies Act 1949, which was later changed as Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  2. Middle phase of Reforming Banking Sector from 1969 to 1991  Government took major steps in Indian Banking Sector reform after independence. In 1955, Government nationalized the Imperial Bank of India with extensive banking facilities on a large scale specially in rural and semi-urban areas. Government formed the State bank of India as principal agent of RBI and to manage banking transactions of the Union Government and state Governments all over the country. Seven banks forming subsidiary of State Bank of India were nationalized in 1960 on 19 July. In 1969, 14 major commercial banks were nationalised. Second phase of nationalization in Indian Banking Sector Reform was carried out in 1980 with seven more banks. This step brought 80% of banking segment in India under Government ownership.  Steps taken by Government of India to regulate Indian Banking System:  1949: Approving Banking Regulation Act. 1955: Natioanlistaion of state bank of India. 1959: Nationalisation of SBI subsidiaries. 1961: Insurance cover extended to deposits. 1969: Nationalisation of 14 Major Banks 1971: Creation of credit guarantee Corporation 1975: Establishment of Regional rural banks 1980: Nationalistaion of six banks with deposits over 200 crores.  ************ We will continue the topic, the last phase of Indian Banking System on very next day. Keep Practicing.  Dailyhunt	|Monday, 19 Dec, 3.25 am

Voting in Karnataka will be held on 12 May and will be held in a single phase, while counting is slated for 15 May. The Model code of conduct for the candidates has already begun and will end on May 28. This had the leaders of Tamil Nadu worried. They were anxious whether the Centre will be able to set up the Cauvery Management Board as directed by the Supreme Court since it also involves Karnataka as a party. Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat has put all doubts to rest. "Whatever is the direction or the order of the honorable court and compliance thereof, Commission and MCC doesn't come in the way," said Rawat which means the formation of the board cannot be stalled because of Karnataka election.  Union government can follow Supreme court's directive to Cauvery Management Board. The Supreme Court had on February 16 delivered the final verdict on the Cauvery water sharing dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In its order, Tamil Nadu would get 177.25 tmcft water, while Karnataka would get 14.75 tmcft more than it was allocated in the previous judgement. But now the bone of contention between the two states is the word 'Scheme' in the order. While Tamil Nadu says that 'scheme' meant the Cauvery Management Board, Karnataka has said that there is no mention of the Cauvery Management Board and only a 'scheme' is mentioned.

Know how Revamped Delhi aim to get their hands on the elusive trophy | Having failed to make their mark in the last couple of Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons, a revamped Delhi Daredevils led by Gautam Gambhir will aim to get their hands on the elusive trophy. On of the major advantages for perennial underachievers Delhi is that unlike other franchises, they are laced with some good quality all-rounders along with a aggressive captain this time around.    Coming to his home team, Gambhir will likely to add a new enthusianm to the side as he has helped his previous outfit Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to clinch two seasons (2012, 2014) of the cash-rich league.  In the last five seasons, Delhi finished at the bottom of the points table. In 2013, they finished ninth, in 2014 (eighth), in 2015 (seventh), in 2016 (sixth), in 2017 (sixth). From the last season, Delhi retained wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant, opener Shreyas Iyer, and all-rounder Chris Morris for the upcoming edition. At the auctions, they managed to grab Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell, who they bought for Rs 9 crore followed by South Africa pacer Kagiso Rabada (Rs 4.2 crore) which will only add more fire to the squad.    So unlike the other seasons, this time the batting and the bowling departments seem sorted out. At the top of the order, Gautam Gambhir, Jason Roy, Colin Munro, Shreyas Iyer and Prithvi Shaw will have the responsibility to score big runs. The middle-order also have many options this time. Glen Maxwell, Chris Morris, Rahul Tewatia, Jayany Yadav, Manjot Kalra and others. The bowling department will be led by pacer Kagiso Rabada alongside Mohammed Shami, Trent Boult and Chris Morris. Experienced leg-spinner Amit Mishra will also play a crucial role. Squad: Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, Chris Morris, Glenn Maxwell, Kagiso Rabada, Amit Mishra, Shahbaz Nadeem, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Mohammad Shami, Gautam Gambhir, Trent Boult, Colin Munro, Daniel Christian, Jason Roy, Naman Ojha, Prithvi Shaw, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Avesh Khan, Abhishek Sharma, Jayant Yadav, Harshal Patel, Manjot Kalra, Sandeep Lamichhane, Sayan Ghosh.

Ashish Vidyarthi? | At least two videos on YouTube showed actor Ashish Vidyarthi as the father of Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love Story's wink sensation Priya Varrier. But is it true? Absolutely not. Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago

In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history.

Well if we believe the words of Yuvraj, it is none other than Virat Kohli.  Appearing on the YouTube show Breakfast with Champions which is being hosted by Gaurav Kapur, Yuvraj, while answering that who is the most Kanjoos (miser) players in the team, named Virat Kohli.  "The best way to make Virat Kohli pay the bills is by calling him 'Kanjoos'," Yuvraj had said.  According to a report in "The Times of India", Kohli, who appeared in the latest episode of the show after being inspired from Ashish Nehra, was asked that if he is the most miser person in the team, explained it.   "Unka (Yuvraj's) seedha seedha hisab h ki koi mera mahaul banaye use phle tum hi bna do to koi question hi nhi kar sakta (Yuvraj's logic is to bring other people in limelight before anybody brings him so that nobody questions)," said Virat.  Virat further revealed that Yuvraj used to call and tell him to order food but didn't tell what to order and later criticised the food.  "Meko phone karke bolte the Cheeku rotia (Chapati) manga, mene pucha aur kya order karu to bolte the kuch bhi manga le. Aur phir pahli bite khate hi ye koi khana h bilkul useless," said Virat.  "He always wants to criticise other people and doesn't sit calm until he does that," the skipper further said albeit on a lighter note.  The YouTube show on which many cricketers have appeared has revealed many funny instances of the players and becoming very popular on the internet. Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 12 Nov, 11.00 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/10+things+about+the+all+new+bajaj+pulsar+that+you+should+know-newsid-84884499| News 10 things about the all-new Bajaj Pulsar that you should know | Bajaj Pulsars have been around for a long time now. The current design of the Bajaj Pulsar was introduced way back in 2010 and since then, the baseline Pulsar models like the Pulsar 150, 180 and 220 are bringing the same design forward with slight changes. That is set to change soon as Bajaj is working on the all-new generation of Pulsars and here's everything that you want to know about them. Will get new looks Picture used for representational purposes only The current generation of original Pulsar trio - Pulsar 150, Pulsar 180 and Pulsar 220 all look a little out of date now. The new generation of bikes will get many refreshed parts that will add a new look to the line-up. Bajaj will update the new Pulsars with a new tail section, that is expected to look sharp and modern when compared to the current models. The bikes will also get different swing arms and new alloy wheels to catch the attention. However, nothing has been said about the shape of the tank. the iconic shape may be retained to carry forward the silhouette of the current gen Pulsars.  New features too    The new Bajaj Pulsar will become modern with the update. The new bike will borrow many features from the flagship bike, Dominar 400. One such feature will be the LED headlamp unit. The Dominar was the first Bajaj bike to get an all-LED headlamp. The new gen Pulsars will come with the similar feature. The new range will also get rear monoshock. Advanced engines Picture used for representational purposes only Bajaj is working on new generation of engines for the new Pulsars. The new engines are being developed from scratch. The new engine will get features like fuel injection to meet with the more stringent pollution norms. As the Pulsar bikes have always been known for their performance, features like 4 valve will also be standard. This will make the new Pulsars even more exciting. Bajaj is working to make cleaner BS VI compliant engines that will debut with the new Pulsars. The new engines will be much cleaner than the current BS-IV compliant engines. The Indian government has set a deadline of 2020 for the introduction of BS VI vehicles in India and the new Bajaj engine will be future-ready. Fewer vibrations One thing that the current generation of Pulsars is criticised for is the vibrations. The engine is not as refined as many rivals of the bike. This harshness creates vibrations that make the Pulsar quite uncomfortable, especially during the long rides. The new generation of the Pulsar will get much more refined engines, which means a fewer number of vibrations and much better comfort than the current generation bike. Will be safer The new Pulsar range will get standard single-channel ABS. This will make them much safer than the current breed. Currently, Bajaj does not offer ABS with the Pulsar 150, 180 and 220. The Indian government has also made the ABS mandatory for all the 125cc and above motorcycles launched after 1st April 2018. Better outputs With the new engines that get fuel injection in the new Pulsar, the maximum power output will improve which means the bikes will offer much better performance than the current generation bikes. Because of the addition of the fuel injection, it will also mean that the new Pulsars will be fuel efficient too. This will be a winning situation as lower fuel input and more power output will make the customers happy. Will be significantly expensive Picture used for representational purposes only With additions like new engines, fuel injection, LED headlamps and ABS, the motorcycle will become significantly expensive than the current versions. The fuel injection and ABS are quite expensive and are expected to add at least Rs. 15,000 to the cost. With the arrival of mandatory ABS and stricter pollution compliance, the prices of all the two-wheelers are expected to go up. No more Pulsar 180 The Pulsar 180 is sandwiched between the Pulsar 160 and the Pulsar 200. In the new avatar, the Pulsar 180 will be almost similar to the Pulsar 200, which will leave a very thin gap between the two models that will confuse the customers. To remove this confusion, Bajaj may do away with the Pulsar 180 when the all-new generation arrives. A bigger Pulsar in sight The new engine platform will have flexible displacement and will be able to go up to 220cc. But Bajaj is said to be working on the Pulsar 250, which can be launched with the next-generation product line-up. Currently, the 220cc displacement is the largest that you get in Pulsar. Also, there is no bridge between the Dominar and the Pulsar range. The new 250cc Pulsar will bring these two bikes closer in the product line-up. Launch soon Picture used for representational purposes only The new products are expected to be launched by 2019. This will be before the 2020 deadline of BS VI compliant engines.

The show is running since 28 July 2008 on SAB TV.  The show is a light-comedy TV series which is inspired from the famous Gujarati writer Taarak Mehta. He wrote series of stories titled, "Duniya Ne Undha Chashma."  Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah has been a big hit on the Television because of the funny plot it follows, its quirky characters, excellent script and brilliant direction. Every character in the show has a unique identity, and viewers love them.  Of late, many prominent actors from this serial have quit it for some or the other reason. Dayaben aka Disha Vakani is in the news for leaving the show, check out the reason.  Raj Anadkat, 19-year old Mumbai resident, has now entered the show. Bhavya Gandhi, popularly known as Tipendra Jethalal Gada aka Tapu has quit the show. After eight years, the young actor decided to do something new and challenging and therefore left the show.  Mr and Mrs Bhide's daughter is Sonu in the TV show. Jheel Mehta played Sonu's role. Jheel Mehta was replaced by Nidhi Bhanushali in 2012. One of the reasons why Jheel decided to quit was that she wanted to focus on her studies. Also, she had become too tall to play Sonu's role.   Gurucharan Singh, best known as Sodhi, left the serial due to differences with the producer of the show, Asit Modi. Laad Singh Maan replaced the Sardar. But they (Asit Modi and Gurucharan) cleared the differences and Gurucharan made a comeback as Sodhi again. As a result, Laad exited the show.  Mrs Roshan's role was played by Jennifer Mistry. She quit the show because she was pregnant and was replaced by actress Dilkhush Reporter in 2013. In 2016, Jennifer got back to the show.  Disha Vakani aka Dayaben is the show's star attraction in Taarak Mehta Ka Oltah Chashmah. Her maddening jokes and queer way of speaking have made her a favourite of viewers.  The reports by DNA India says that Disha is pregnant with her first child and will go on maternity leave soon.  Dayaben will not quit the show. She will be back soon after she delivers her baby.But we will miss her. After all, her perky character has won our hearts, and it would not be easy to watch the show without her, isn't it?  The question now is whether Vakani's absence will affect the show's TRP? Time alone will tell. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 12 Jun, 6.04 pm

Despite not being a biological daughter of Salim Khan, she has always been the most loved member of their family.   It is said that Arpita was adopted by Salman's parents Salim and Salma Khan. There are different stories around in the media, around her adoption.   While some say that Arpita's mother was a beggar and lived on a footpath. She died right after giving birth to Arpita.

The reports in the media also state that Salim's second wife Helen was the one who adopted Arpita. This is how Arpita became an Angel from an orphan.

The above quote perfectly matches with her chic and confident personality as she is full of strong mettle and enthusiasm to achieve bigger and better every next time.

She began her YouTube channel on August 14, 2012. She posted her first video called "summer style turkey" there on September 7, 2012 while on her first internship trip to Turkey, as she was already an enthusiast of videography. It's just a matter of time and now she has managed to get over 3,77,972 subscribers to her YouTube channel as well as gained over 2,24,000 followers to her Instagram, which acts as an extension of her channel.

Let's explore more about this Stylish and Chic Youtube Sensation in the interview down below. In conversation with 'Sejal Kumar' :  1) Sejal, who is the inspiration behind your 'YouTube' channel ?   One of the first YouTuber I discovered: Bethany Mota is the real inspiration behind me starting my youtube channel. She is an American video blogger and in her super cool videos she does various clothing hauls and also uploads videos of outfit ideas, makeup and hair tutorials, recipes and do it yourself crafts.   2) What are your goals when it com es to YouTube ?   My immediate goal is to get million subscribers on my youtube channel and a more long term goal is to build a sustainable business. I have enjoyed making all my videos so much that I want to keep doing this for the rest of my life.   3) What do you think is the hardest thing about becoming a youtuber ?   I think the most difficult part is to manage every aspect, the creative, business as well as the marketing aspects behind every single youtube video.

My favorite thing about YouTube community is that everyone is very humble and of course a lot of fun as they all do crazy things on camera.I have always believed in portraying my real self and youtube gives me the power to do that. It's like I'm living a dream with my eyes open.   5) What do you think, you could bring to the YouTube community that isn't already there ?   It took me a long time to realize what my unique point is and I can finally say that it is my diversified content. I have fashion videos, sketches, travel vlogs, dance and music videos all on my channel. It is an extension of all my interests.   6) What's the funniest thing you have ever done when you were really bored?   While I'm bored, I usually scour few of my subscribers on my social media accounts. That is something I do when I'm really bored and have nothing else to do. Being a student and a vlogger hardly leaves you with any free time though.   7) If there is one time or moment in the last year or month, that you would change, what moment would it be?   I would like to completely change the moment when my camera got stolen at The YouTube Fan Fest. I had left it in my green room for 5 minutes to be precise and it was gone. I wish I had kept it with myself throughout. I really don't understand why would anyone do such a thing.   8) Focusing on your career aspirations. Ten years from now, where do you see yourself?   Focusing on my career, I probably see myself heading a successful business. I have always wanted that and I am sure and hopeful that with continued hard work and support from my fans and followers, I will surely achieve that one day.  9) Any tips or advice for the young aspirants who are aiming to start a YouTube channel?  My only advice and tip would be that all of you young aspirants should do a lot of research before starting a channel. Start a channel only because you truly love creating videos and then just go for i and hopefully you will never have to look back.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/india+press+agency-epaper-indpres/smriti+irani+april+fooled+on+april+3-newsid-84934126| Home Smriti irani april-fooled on april 3! |  Aditya Aamir  Information & Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani proposes and the PMO disposes! But not to her liking. Late on April 2, Irani directed that journalists who "create and publish fake news" will face six months' suspension for the first violation; one year for a second and will be permanently iced after the third. On April 3, the PMO held that the PIB and NBA are supreme and that the "punishment regime' suggested by Irani stands discredited, her order withdrawn. News is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself strode into the PMO to axe Ms Irani's diktat. The question then is: Did Smriti Irani takes a unilateral decision? Or, did the PM realize it better than her that PIB accreditation allows journalists only to cover government functions and entry into government buildings? A journalist needs no government accreditation to cover news on the ground; he/she is a free-bird.  Ms Irani had delivered her diktat on April 2, 2018. If it was April 1, everyone would have taken it as an attempt to 'April Fool' journalists and she would have been in the news for creating 'Fake News'. Now, she is in the news for being fooled the day after April Fool Day! That said, if 'Fake News' sat in front of Smriti Irani and told her its story she wouldn't know it from Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. Ms Irani is a byproduct of Bollywood, that ultimate dream factory, India's soft-power, which weaves fantasies and puts actors in the role of journalists knowing zilch about journalism, real journalism. With few exceptions, filmy-journalists have portrayed journalists in hack-roles, the butt of ire and derision. Some of Smriti Irani's directions and orders in recent months, ever since she was reinstated by PM Narendra Modi in his cabinet, has done 'real' damage to journalist morale in Doordarshan, cutting to the quick the autonomous Prasar Bharati. Smriti Irani has no idea the effect her one thoughtless diktat can have on the journalist-fraternity. There is no two ways that this latest one was out and out an attempt to crack down on journalists. It was an unalloyed threat to self-censor or else. Sure, there are 'fake journalists' with PIB accreditation; journalists who haven't written or even concocted a news story in two decades and more but get government accreditation only because they have links to a unheard of publishing house in some remote location which purportedly brings out a 'newspaper/magazine' that nobody has read or heard about. That is another story and not fake! Anyway, the real story on April 3 morning was that Smriti Irani had amended the 'Guidelines for Accreditation of Journalists' with the ostensible reason that there were rising instances of fake news across media, in newspapers and on TV channels. In her wisdom, Irani left websites and social media platforms - Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp - out of the 'Wake'. That was good news for the likes of Cambridge Analytica. Amended, the Irani-guidelines said that 'fake news" in print media would be referred to the Press Council of India (PCI) and those in electronic media would be sent to the News Broadcasters' Association (NBA) for action taken. That PCI and NBA would decide in 15 days' time if a piece of news was fake or not. And for those 15 days the journalist who wrote or propagated the news item would sit on his rump and play Tweedledum and Tweedledee. True, Press Information Bureau (PIB) accreditation entitles journalists to several benefits, including access to government buildings and official functions. On April 1, Smriti Irani and several of her cabinet colleagues tweeted an article from a website, which claimed to have busted four major fake news stories in a week. The real news was that the I&B ministry was turning into a fact-checking outfit and that was not fake news! But while declaring war on journalists Irani left unclear what news qualified for 'Fake News', in other words, without any fake inputs from the government. What was the definition and nature of 'fake news' in the government's eyes? There was nothing on that in Smriti Irani's statement. The fact of the matter is a journalist is accredited to PIB after he/she has completed five years of full-time journalism. Freelance journalists need to have 15 years of the same. Foreign journalists should have five years and a valid work visa to report news from India. Smriti Irani has her office in the same building which has the PIB office and journalists are a ubiquitous presence in Shastri Bhavan. In 70 years, nobody who graced the chair she holds had attempted to 'gherao' journalists the way this minister did. In this year of the "unprecedented", honest journalists - and there are thousands of them in the country who work without PIB accreditation - should tell Smriti Irani to take a hike, to Bollywood! Ms Irani looked like she has agenda. And just because PM Modi has rescinded her order doesn't mean she will sit quiet. The mass of journalists should boycott every Smriti Irani presser/meet. At the same time scrutinize every one of her actions and non-actions and come to definite conclusions backed with facts and figures to expose her agenda. Let Smriti Irani be the focus of news. Uncover Irani's motives behind every one of her actions, such as this one. The big fact is fake news is the preserve of politicians and political parties. They are the ones who concoct news and spread it by whatever means to 'far and wide'. (IPA Service)  Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 03 Apr, 9.04 am2 weeks agoa week ago2 weeks ago9 hrs ago7 days ago

In fact, the Compass now even outsells the XUV500 - a best-seller for years. Such has been the appeal of the Compass that Jeep is now gearing up to launch more affordable SUVs in India. According to the Detroit Free Press, the Renegade is the next big launch for the Indian market from Jeep. The Renegade will be a butch SUV that offers a more rugged alternative to the likes of the Hyundai Creta and Maruti Suzuki S-Cross, both of which are more of crossovers than SUVs. Like the Compass, Jeep India will be looking at heavy localization for the Renegade as well. The SUV is expected to borrow the 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engine from the Compass, but in a lower state of tune. Jeep may use the 140 Bhp and 210 Nm state of tune on the Renegade, which is the same tune that is offered on the Abarth range of Fiat cars such as the Punto, Avventura and Urban Cross. The diesel engine is expected to be the 1.6-litre Fiat Multijet unit that the company used to supply Maruti. This engine makes 120 Bhp and 320 Nm.  Both engines could use 6-speed manual gearboxes as standard. Automatic gearboxes are also likely to be offered considering the fact that the Indian SUV market now demands it, even in affordable segments. The Renegade will be front wheel driven on most variants while Jeep is also expected to offer a fully loaded, Trailhawk variant to differentiate this SUV from the many crossovers that are on sale in India. More details on Jeep's strategy will be known as the launch timeframe for the Renegade approaches.    For now, it appears that the Renegade could make it to India sometime next year considering that the Compass will be a couple of years old by then. As is the case with the Compass, the Fiat factory at Ranjangaon could become an export hub for the Renegade as well. Jeep is able to deliver high quality vehicles for demanding export markets, as evidenced by the Compass's exports, which now total over 7,000 units. A similar strategy with the Renegade could help Jeep garner high profits as selling in export markets is likely to make the project viable.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

One of which is an important and simple means is animals. The cow is also one of them. Cow is worshipable in Hinduism. According to Shakun Shastra, while going on the journey, the cow gives us an indication of the events happening in the future through its activities. Although now things like cow-cattle do not work in cities or it is difficult to see the cow, in such a way these signs do not work, these signs were reported by the sages when the circumstances were very different. However, if we look at the cow while we are on the journey, then we can guess some things. # While traveling, if the voice of the cow is heard from the left side, it is considered auspicious.# At the time of the night if the cow recites or calls the Hoonara, it is considered auspicious.# On the contrary, if someone sees the cow raging or crying in the middle of the night, then you may have to face the tremendous fear of traveling.  # If the cow going to visit a cow appears scratched from his hooves then he may have to face the disease in the coming time.# If the cow is crying while going on a trip, the traveler is expected to suffer similarly to death.# If the passenger appears to meet the cow with his calf, then the sum total of all his wishes is made.# When many flies appear over the cow, there is a possibility of good rainfall.# If you see a person on both sides of the buffalo while traveling, then the fear of death of the passenger remains.# If a person sees the bull going on his right side from right to left then it is considered auspicious.# If a person is seen digging the ground with his horn or hoof while traveling on a journey, it is also considered auspicious.

Ashish Vidyarthi? | At least two videos on YouTube showed actor Ashish Vidyarthi as the father of Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love Story's wink sensation Priya Varrier. But is it true? Absolutely not. Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/ever+wondered+why+lord+krishna+never+married+radha-newsid-73193012| History & Religion Ever Wondered Why Lord Krishna Never Married Radha? |  Here's the real reason why!   This question has been on my mind ever since my childhood. Most of us have watched the famous daily soap that starred a cute kid in Lord Krishna's avatar. The show completely justified the happenings that took place in Kanha's life, but unlike me have you also wondered about the fact that why did he end up marrying Rukmini instead of Radha?  The unconditional love that both of them had for each other is something that we are never going to find in any generation. But why is that they never lived together or had a family? Lord Krishna is believed to have approximately 16,000 wives, why isn't Radha one of them?  There are a lot of scriptures that claim the answer to these questions and different versions have different answers for the readers. We have got it all compiled for you here. But, before we get the answers to all our questions, let's have some background check about the subject of the story.  Well, to all the newbies, I mean the next gen kids, he is a Hindu God of compassion, tenderness, and love and is also believed to be the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu.   Radha aka Radharani is believed to be the lover and the most represented companion of Lord Krishna. But, even after getting a lot of mention she never ended up with Krishna.   Read further to know why?   When Krishna was a little boy, he would go by the lake, in Gokul, and start playing the flute for the grazing cows. He continued to do this every day. However, one Gopi, Radha, had captivated him. The whole universe yearned for Krishna, but he yearned for Radha.  That happens with everyone but what's so unusual about it?   According to an article, the unusual thing about this love tale was that Radha was married to Abhimanyu (not the one from Mahabharata) and this is not enough, there were more reasons why the couple never stayed like normal couples.   Read further to know all the possible reasons.   As per Speaking Tree, the reason why this couple did not marry each other is because they had to define the fine line that exists between marrying someone and loving someone. The eternal love that they had for each other could never suffice by giving a tag to their love tale.   According to Speaking Tree, after being so close to Krishna, Radha finally realised that he was not a common man. She was in love with him the way a devotee loves God but it was misunderstood as physical love. Therefore the question of marriage completely disappeared from the picture.  Read further to know other versions of this story.   She is believed to be his energy which pleases and possesses unconditional love to him. Since there is the only element, they did not marry each other.   According to some versions of the story, it is noted that Radha refused to marry Lord Krishna because she felt that she wouldn't be able to adjust in his household because of the fact that she was a cowgirl and people expected Kanha to marry a Princess.  An incident stated that once when Radha asked Krishna, why he wouldn't marry her. He simply said, "How can one marry his or her own soul?"  Their conversation proved that they are a single entity and are not different from each other in spirit and existence.  Radha and Krishna's love can never be compared to earthly definitions and explanations. It is unparalleled and a startling example of the human race to proclaim the supreme union between the human and divine energy around us that is God.  That's all, people.

Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/hackers+break+into+naukri+com+steal+over+1+l+resumes-newsid-84435702| Bangalore Hackers break into Naukri.com, steal over 1 L resumes | Nigerian hackers have broken into the Naukri.com server and have stolen nearly one lakh resumes. The incident came to light after an IT firm 'Klaus' which manages Naukri.com's server registered a complaint with the CID Cyber Crime division. Officials from the CID Cyber Crime cell had written a letter to the company's headoffice in Mumbai seeking an explanation about the hack. Kalus IT Solutions representatives stated in their complaint that Naukri.com had outsourced the work of maintaining their server with the city-based IT firm over a period of time. Klaus charges Naukri.com anywhere between Rs 3 and Rs 5 to maintain each resume of millions of job seekers who register on Naukri.  The complainant also stated this is the first time the server has been hacked. Soon after they came to know about the hack, the firm took measures to protect the remaining existent database of the server. But by then, a lakh resumes were already stolen, they said in the complaint. Preliminary investigations by Cybercrime cell revealed the IP address of the laptop used for hacking originated from Nigeria. On the Naukri.com website, there is an option called 'New to Naukri' for first-time job seekers. On this option, one can upload an attachment sized 2 MB which goes to the server managed and maintained by Klaus IT Solution in the City. Klaus then retrieves the resumes from the server and matches them with requirement from companies to intimate them about job offers. Cybercrime sources said, initially, the hackers hacked the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) of the Naukri website and later they breached their server. The police suspect that within three days, the hackers downloaded at least three lakh resumes. Looting job-seekers Using the information on the stolen resumes, hackers are now contacting job aspirants faking that they are from reputed multinational companies. They are luring job seekers into paying money for back-door entries. There have been several reports of job aspirants who were cheated in a similar manner and complaints have been lodged. The hackers have used the names of companies such as Wipro, Bosch, Airtel, Accenture, and many others. If one responds to their mail, they are next asked to pay up for registration, interviews. Nearly 10,000 job aspirants have been contacted and attempted to be cheated. Senior police officials from the Cybercrime cell said job aspirants need to be careful while responding to such e-mails and verify the authenticity of the emails before they go ahead with the job offer. A few of the job aspirants have also started receiving calls stating that they were from banks and they could process loans if they are interested. Out of 808 complaints registered before the Cybercrime cell until March 23, 250 complaints were related to fake job offers and bank loans. Since Kalus IT Solutions is a vendor company involved, we have written to the chief of Naukri.com to come and register a formal police complaint, said a Cybercrime official.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/lifeberrys+english-epaper-lifebeen/5+health+benefits+of+banana+flower-newsid-85754190| Healthy Living 5 Health Benefits Of Banana Flower | Almost all the parts of banana tree has wonderful uses and the banana flower is no exception. Banana flowers have wonderful medicinal properties and we should include it as often as we can in our diet. Banana flowers are called valaipoo in Tamil, Mocha in Bengali, Kelful in Hindi. Many don't use banana flowers because of the work involved in cleaning the flower, but it is so worth the effort. To clean banana flowers first oil your hands to prevent discoloration and then remove the red petals one by one. You will see a bunch of white florets inside each petal (it is shown in the main picture), now take each floret and open it using the hands. You will find a transparent, reddish part remove it along with the thick stamen, do this for each floret. Continue peeling the petals and cleaning the florets like mentioned above till you reach the middle inner white part. Now cut the cleaned up florets and immerse it in thin buttermilk. You can also cut the white middle part finely and add it to the buttermilk. This might take from 30 to 45 minutes depending on the size of the flower you are using. * For menstrual problems & weight loss Banana flower is one of the best home remedy for excessive bleeding in women as it helps increase progesterone in the body. To make the remedy, cook the 1/4 cup of cleaned banana flower in little water and salt till completely cooked and let it cool completely. Now add grind little coconut (1/4 cup) with 2 g.chillies and 1/2 tsp cumin seeds to a fine, thick paste. Add the ground coconut mixture to a cup of thick yogurt along with the cooked banana flowers and required salt. Have this along with rice for a few days when you have excess bleeding. This gravy also can be included in weight loss diet as it full of fiber and nutrients, is very soothing on the stomach and tastes great! I love to eat it with rice during hot summer months for lunch.* For diabetics A study conducted showed that insulin levels lowered for diabetic patients when banana flower extracts were given to them. Though the study is not proven clinically, it is a good idea for diabetics to include banana flowers in their diet as often as they can. Make this simple banana flower stir fry as often as you can: In a pan heat oil and season with mustard seeds and once it crackles, add 1/2 tsp of urad dal and channa dal and fry for a few seconds till they brown a little and then add 1/ 8 cup of cut shallots and curry leaves. Fry well and now add the cleaned and cut banana flowers ( 1cup) along with a tsp of sambar powder, 1/4 tsp of turmeric powder and salt. Cover and cook till it is fully done. Open the lid and fry in low flame till the water evaporates fully and finally add a tbsp of fresh coconut scrapings and switch off. This traditional, simple stir fry has amazing health benefits and should be included in everyone's diet, especially in diabetic patients diet to keep the blood sugar stable.     * For pcos & uterus health Banana flower comes to the rescue if you suffer from pcos and in fact keeps the uterus in peak health. I have always loved and enjoyed cooking and nothing makes me more happy than making delicious home cooked food and serving my family and friends. Though I love to cook fancy foods once in a while, I get tired of them soon and always prefer simple home cooked with traditional ingredients that keep us healthy. This simple decoction made with banana flowers is a good home remedy for pcos and for all the problems of the uterus. To make the decoction, take the cleaned banana flowers and boil it along with few peppercorns and cumin seeds pounded coarsely together along with 1/4 tsp of turmeric powder and salt till it is reduced in half. Drink this decoction if you are suffering from any problems related to uterus.* For pregnant women I am sure many of you must have been advised to include banana flower in your diet during your pregnanacy. Banana stem is high in fiber and it prevents constipation during pregnancy. This homemade banana flower pancakes is a delicious way to consume banana flower during pregnancy. To make the dosai or adai or Indian pancakes soak 1cup rice along with 1/4 cup toor dhal, 2 tbsp urad dhal, 1 tbsp moong dhal and 1tbsp channa dhal in water overnight. The next day morning first grind 2 red chillies, a small piece of asafoetida, little bit of coconut and a tsp of cumin seeds finely and then add the soaked dhal and grind to a coarse paste along with required salt. Fry the cleaned and cut banana flower in little bit of oil and add to the batter and make dosais. These pancakes are very filling, high in fiber and will greatly prevent pregnancy constipation. If this recipe seems too laborious, take the fried banana stem flower and add to the regular dosai batter along with little fried onions, g.chilli and coriander leaves and make thick dosais. Banana flower if fried with spice powders like turmeric powder, coriander, cumin, garam masala powders along with onions and tomatoes can be used as a filling for anything. If you are not used to eating dosai and adais try using banana flower mixture that I mentioned above as a filling for sandwiches, tortillas, flat breads, etc along with other spices that you use regularly for the filling like mayo, mustard, etc.* For lactating mothers Banana flowers are amazing for lactating mothers as it helps increase the breast milk supply. As you can see banana flowers are a real boon to women of all ages: it treats excessive bleeding, keeps the uterus healthy, prevents constipation during pregnancy and improves lactation, so please try including banana flower in your diet. Banana flower has a bland, starchy taste so always combine it with other spices to make it taste good. A little creativity in cooking is all needed for consuming this amazing flower. When selecting banana flowers always select flowers that are fresh and one way to ensure that it is fresh is when you open the petal, the florets should be firm and fresh, if they are discolored then the flower is old.

Arpita Khan Sharma, who considered as the most loved sister of 'Khandaan.' We have always seen Salman Khan and his family shower love and care on this 28-year-old daughter of their family. The entire fans of Bollywood admire the Khandaan for being such a sweet family. Arpita Khan Sharma who turned 28 on August 1, despite never being a part of Hindi Films, has always been a popular name among the fans of Bollywood. She has always been the talk of the town, for all the good reasons of course. Arpita who is the youngest sister of Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail Khan, is very close to her brother and especially an apple of Salman's eye. When the news of Arpita wedding with her longtime boyfriend Ayush Sharma surfaced, it made it to the headlines of all the leading newspapers, mags and channels.  Needless to say, that when it came to his adorable sister Arpita's wedding, Salman and the entire 'Khandaan' didn't leave a stone unturned to make it a fairytale one. So, on this auspicious occasion of Rakhi, we are here to tell you something about the most fortunate sister of tinsel town. Here are some lesser-known facts about Arpita Khan Sharma's life, we bet you didn't know.  Arpita was born on August 1, 1989. Despite not being a biological daughter of Salim Khan, she has always been the most loved member of their family.   It is said that Arpita was adopted by Salman's parents Salim and Salma Khan. There are different stories around in the media, around her adoption.   While some say that Arpita's mother was a beggar and lived on a footpath. She died right after giving birth to Arpita. And Salim and Salma spotted this infant near her dead body on the footpath they were passing by. Hence, they brought her home along and decided to make her a part of their family forever.   The reports in the media also state that Salim's second wife Helen was the one who adopted Arpita. This is how Arpita became an Angel from an orphan.  Very few people know that Arpita has really got a great fashion sense. She is a fashion graduate from London College Of Fashion and holds a degree in fashion marketing and management.   Before Arpita got married to Ayush Sharma, she used to work for an architectural and interior designing firm. This Beti of 'Khandaan' dreams of owning her own fashion brand one day.  In the year 2014, Arpita got a tattoo of a star, which contains the names of all her family members. The tattoo has got Salim Khan, mothers Salma and Helen, brothers Salman, Arbaaz. Sohail, sister Alvira and friend Deeksha.   This isn't much known that when Arpita dated Arjun Kapoor for two years. When Arpita and Arjun were in a relationship Arjun weighed 140 Kgs. But fate had some other plans for this couple. Arjun and Arpita broke up and the reason for their split is still not known. Seems like their break up didn't affect Arjun's terms with Khandaan and especially Salman Khan, Coz he is still close to that family.  Once again, cupid struck Arpita when she met Delhi based businessman, Ayush Sharma. Ayush hails from Delhi and belongs to a royal family. Unlike Arpita, Ayush has got plans to make Bollywood debut soon.  Arpita's wedding with Ayush Sharma is considered as the most expensive wedding of B-town. If the reports are to be believed, Arpita always wanted to get married in a palace. Ergo, Salman who can make all possible efforts to make his sister's wish come true booked the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad for her wedding. Her fairytale wedding was a Star studded affair.  Arpita is now happily married to Ayush and gave birth to a baby, Ahil, in March 2016. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 14 Aug, 6.41 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/royal+enfield+classic+thunderbird+bullet+himalayan+motorcycles+abs+details+revealed-newsid-85666487| CarToq Royal Enfield Classic, Thunderbird, Bullet & Himalayan motorcycles: ABS details revealed | Royal Enfield will soon equip its entire range of retro-styled motorcycles with life-saving ABS safety technology. We now have details of what kind of ABS each Royal Enfield motorcycle will get. While the Bullet, Classic and Thunderbird range is expected to get single channel ABS, the Himalayan and the upcoming Interceptor and Continental GT 650 twins will receive dual/twin channel ABS. This strategy will allow Royal Enfield to keep the price increase (due to ABS addition) low on its best selling motorcycles. ABS equipped Royal Enfield are likely to be rolled out in weeks from now. The company already exports ABS equipped motorcycles to markets around the world.  ABS stands for anti-lock braking system, a technology that ensures that wheels don't lock up even during emergency braking, thus preventing the rider from losing balance due to a skid. Skids invariably occur when brakes of a motorcycle lock up during emergency braking, leaving the rider unable to steer the motorcycle. This causes a lot of accidents, and ABS is meant to prevent this. Single channel ABS is cheaper, and acts only on the front wheel of the motorcycle while dual channel ABS is more expensive, and acts on both wheels. Dual channel ABS is better than single channel ABS due to the increased control it offers. However, single channel ABS is better than not having ABS at all. The Indian government has made it mandatory for all new two wheelers with engines measuring 125cc or more to have ABS as compulsary from the 1st of April, 2018. Existing two wheelers have until the 1st of April, 2019, to comply with this rule. This move will make Indian roads a lot safer as ABS will prevent many accidents due to skids. Riding two wheelers is particularly treacherous during wet weather. ABS will be an additional layer of protection while riding in the wet. It will not only reduce braking distance in most cases as the rider can brake hard without worrying about the brakes locking, but will also allow riders to steer around obstacles even under hard braking.

Check out for CBN too! |   10 Reasons why YS Jagan will not win 2019 AP Assembly Elections    The 2019 Andhra Pradesh Assembly Elections fever has already started in the state. With Pawan Kalyan announcing that he would be completely devoted to politics from here on, ignoring his film career, the 2019 elections race got spicier. In the 2014 elections, YS Jagan led YSRCP won 67 seats, with 44.47% votes polled in favour of them. While Chandrababu Naidu led TDP won 102 seats with 46.3% votes polled in favour of them. Though the difference in voting percentage between the two parties is less than 2%, the difference in seats is 35. If it was not for Pawan Kalyan's support towards the TDP-BJP alliance, there would have been greater chances of YS Jagan forming the government.    YS Jagan failed completely to strengthen YSRCP party in the past four years. Many leaders left YSRCP and joined TDP during this time. Vangaveeti Radha Krishna might soon ditch YSRCP and join TDP.   What's more shocking is, Jagan is finding hard to gather capable leaders to contest in the 175 assembly constituencies. Jagan should blame himself for exposing his never-ending greed to power. His involvement in money laundering cases, explains his favouritism towards CBI. Following are the 10 reasons that Telugu Bullet believes, can hamper Jagan's chances in 2019 AP Assembly elections:   These facts against Jagan are definitely not in favour of Chandrababu Naidu. The TDP was lucky enough to win in 2014, thanks to Janasena's support. With Pawan Kalyan himself fighting against CBN's government policies, there is no way that he could extend his support. Moreover, CBN's failure of obtaining 'Special Status', a promise on which the BJP and TDP won at the Centre and State, is something that is causing serious concerns in TDP camp.   There is no clear winner in the upcoming 2019 AP Assembly Elections. We might well see a coalition government formed under TDP-Janasena if Pawan Kalyan chooses to support TDP. Despite anything, the 2019 AP CM is most likely to be Chandrababu Naidu.  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 08 Feb, 3.29 pma month agoa month ago3 weeks ago2 weeks ago2 weeks ago

This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

A rumour was spread by a Pakistani website called Outlook Pakistan which claimed that she committed suicide owing to growing tensions with her in-laws over her bold performance in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.  Aishwarya Rai and daughter Aaradhya were recently seen at a famous Ganpati pandal during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. Earlier in the week, Abhishek, Aishwarya and Aaradhya were spotted at the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations at Mukesh Ambani's home. A galaxy of stars was there at the Ambani household.

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm3 months ago4 days ago2 months ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/dataquest-epaper-dataquest/a+look+at+the+indian+data+center+market+in+2017-newsid-69657207| Home A Look At The Indian Data Center Market In 2017 | There is a huge growth in the Indian data center market. According to Gartner, India became the second fastest growing market in APAC last year. The current data center market in India is valued at $2.2 billion, and is expected to touch $4.5 billion mark by 2018. Main drivers for this huge increase are growth in data and digital intelligent devices, digitalization and also the government's Digital India campaign.  Captive vs outsourced model  Data centers are usually operated using one of two main models: the first is for an organization to build, operate, and manage its own data center for internal purposes, known as a captive data center. The second is the outsourced model, where organizations lease space and hosting services from external data center providers.  Today, many organizations are moving from a captive data center model to outsourced model because of zero capital investment, high operational efficiency and scalable infrastructure. According to Frost & Sullivan (F&S) Asia Pacific Data Center 2017 report, while there is a greater adoption of managed hosting services (outsourced model), colocation services (captive data center) continue to dominate data center revenue. This will continue to be driven by large enterprises and highly regulated verticals such as banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), which require strict data confidentiality and complete management control of their operations.  Data center localization  Over the past few years, multiple countries have enacted data localization laws. Also, due to regulatory and security reasons, many organizations in India, especially from the BFSI sector, are not willing to host their data in a data center that is out of the country. As a result, the data center providers are forced to set up local data centers in India. Recently, US tech giant Oracle said it will set up a local data center to expand its cloud services. IBM already has two data centers in India (Mumbai and Chennai) and NTT Communications has three (Mumbai, Bangalore and Noida).  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  According to Gartner, India will see Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) eclipse traditional data center outsourcing by the end of this year. In India, traditional data center outsourcing spend is forecast to reach $559 million in 2017, while cloud spending will total $677 million. Gartner analysts also predicted that by 2021, cloud computing and storage as-a-service will be nearly three times more common than traditional data center outsourcing. A bigger focus on cloud, mobility and analytics has made many organizations rethink their data center strategies. Organizations in India are evaluating data center architectures that would provide them the agility, flexibility and the scale desired for new application workloads. Subho Ray, president of IAMAI, believes that India has the potential to capture a big share of the global data center market. But this will only be possible when the country addresses the risks and barriers to data center operations, and creates the right incentives for businesses to build efficient data center infrastructure. Thus, the future of data center market is quite bright in India, but it will all depend on efficiency and scale. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 30 Jun, 1.36 am

The recent raid on Marriott hotel at Tank Bund was just a tip of the iceberg. The police caught 36 persons for gambling at Marriott. These hotels, owned by leading businessmen, are chosen by the organisers of gambling and flesh trade after conniving with the managerial staff for a cut. Earlier, the police busted a prostitution racket after raiding two hotels The Park at Somajiguda and Sitara Grand at Ameerpet. A few pimps were arrested while the police managed to rescue women from Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad who were forced into flesh trade.  The organisers informed the police that they feel safe in star hotels as they are owned by bigwigs. "The rooms are booked via online portals and nobody knows the background of the person who books it. The guests provide the identity proof and occupy it," said a task force official. According to those in the hotel industry, the management seldom probes the guest as it amounts to humiliation and presents a bad image of the brand. "So they just ignore the activities unless they feel there is a threat to other guests or any nuisance on the premises," he said. DCP Shashidhar Raju said that they are issuing a notice to Marriott hotel for allowing such activities in three rooms. "We will issue the notice and seek an explanation," he said.

A source in the Enforcement Directorate confirmed to India Today that Wadhwa, who was arrested last week, has confessed that he helped Nirav Modi, who's the main accused in the Rs 13,700-crore PNB fraud, by creating shell companies to reroute money back to India. "In his series of statements, Wadhwa has admitted that he was assisting (Nirav) Modi, on his instruction, in the forming shell companies to launder the money," the ED source told IndiaToday.In.  Wadhwa also admitted that "(Nirav) Modi exploited the PNB's loan money for circular trading and round-tripping with the support of hawala operators, and to to build personal assets in India and abroad," the source added. Source says Wadhwa is "cooperating" and has provided "strong evidence" against Nirav Modi. Despite initial reluctance, he has shared "all crucial details" with the agency, he add. The ED's custody of Wadhwa will get over on Monday, after which the agency plans to seek his judicial custody before the special PMLA Court in Mumbai. In the initial interrogation, Wadhwa has revealed that he conducted fraudulent transactions for Firestar International and Firestar Diamond International, the companies owned by Nirav Modi, and three other companies - Diamond R US, Stellar Diamond and Solar Exports - owned by his partner and maternal uncle Mehul Choksi. On the instructions of Nirav Modi, Wadhwa allegedly created Hong Kong-based Sino Traders and Aura Gem to launder Rs 5,921 crore, the money Nirav Modi's companies received after the issuance of fake LoUs by some PNB employees. Aura Gems allegedly transferred Rs 468 crore to India in the Axis Bank accounts of Diamond R US, Stellar Diamond and Solar Exports. Likewise, the inward remittance figure to these three India-based firms for Sino Traders was Rs 506.69 crore. "This is nothing but round-tripping, where the money comes back in India," the source said. Wadhwa is also accused of appointing bogus directors and shareholders in the Hong Kong-based Sino Traders and Auro Gems Ltd. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 03 Apr, 11.51 ama week ago

After losing in 2014 AP Assembly elections, YSRCP Supremo YS Jagan is keenly waiting for his chance to conquer the CM chair. Similarly, Chandrababu Naidu wants TDP to come into power and put a check to YSRCP for the next two elections.     Amidst all the high drama, TDP directed two private agencies to carry out survey polls for the upcoming elections. After seeing at the predictions, Chandrababu Naidu was more than delighted. The surveys predicted that TDP would perform much better in 2019 elections, in comparison to 2014 elections. According to the survey, TDP is likely to get between 140 - 145 seats this time around. YSRCP is likely to get 20 - 25 seats against 67 seats previously. Similarly, Pawan Kalyan's Janasena is likely to end up with 5 - 10 seats according to the survey.     What's more surprising is that, TDP will be getting 30 -38 seats this time around. In 2014 AP Assembly elections, TDP won 23 out of 52 seats in Rayalaseema region. Rayalaseema has been a strong foothold for YSRCP in 2014 elections.     Unfortunately, TDP is facing a setback in Nellore and Prakasam districts. No new projects have been awarded to Prakasam district since the announcement of Amaravati as Andhra Pradesh's capital. Similarly, P Narayana's dominance in Nellore district is hampering TDP's chances in the district.   Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 27 Jan, 6.48 pm3 weeks ago2 months ago2 weeks ago2 months ago

Several members of the Congress feel that the problem for the party is not Rahul, but his team members. Once he returns from abroad, he would be told to clean up his entire team and then take over the party. He is currently the vice-president of the party, while his mother Sonia, the president. There is a lot of disgruntlement and anger brewing within the ranks of the Congress. The Uttar Pradesh assembly elections 2017 results saw the Congress failing by a huge margin. The Congress is now on introspective mode and want Rahul to take complete charge.   [UP elections: People have rejected the SP-Congress alliance]  Losing big in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are not the only concerns for the Congress. The party was not able to seize the initiative in Goa and Manipur where it emerged as the single largest party. It watched helplessly the BJP snatching victory from right under its nose and forming the government in both the states. The Congress think-tank feels that there are coalition days ahead and the party would have to enter into a grand alliance with all the opposition parties. If such an alliance is to be formed, then Rahul would have to emerge stronger. For this, he would need to wipe out his core coterie, who many in the party feel has misguided him. Following the  Goa debacle , there was a clamour to drop Digvijaya Singh out of the strategy team. Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar took a jibe at Singh while saying,'This is what happens when you come to Goa and holiday.' Singh was in charge of Goa and was to oversee the government formation, but failed. In this backdrop, there is also a move to remove him from the position of Karnataka in-charge ahead the assembly elections in 2018. The Congress will have to introspect ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, say its leaders. Rahul is currently abroad and will return in a few days time. Once he is back, he would be bombarded with advice and requests to form a brand-new team and take complete control of the party. OneIndia News source: oneindia.com Dailyhunt	|Friday, 24 Mar, 12.42 pm

As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

Jain termed PM Modi as a 'powerful fire' since he was born at 11:11 AM - which is called as 'Chandra Dasha' and matches with 'Draupadi'.  "Modi's birth sign matches with Hindu mythological character Draupadi who was born out of the fire. Hence Modi is mighty. His good times escalated to a new level in 2011 October and will continue till October 2021. Although he will face challenges and come out victorious, he will have to be watchful as he may face new challenges from the Indian border," said Dr Jain.  His Zodiac sign is Scorpio, which is ruled by Mars, Dr Jain says. This means any friction caused by his adversaries will see a reaction. China is aware of India's growing economy and hence may cause conflict, Jain adds.  "Although Modi is capable of waging war, as he has military and nuclear capabilities, he will use his diplomatic skills and gain world leaders support. War is not a solution anywhere in the world now," pointed out Dr Jain. Agreeing with Dr Jain, noted astrologer Daivagna Somayaji KN said, "Yes there will be some tensions across borders during such time but this will not cause much impact. PM Modi will not take important decisions at this time,"  He further added that in the coming month of August, there will be two eclipses - a lunar eclipse on August 7 and a solar eclipse on August 22.  Travelling, meeting people, inviting global leaders for business related-talks and taking any decision - especially related to international affairs and border disputes - will not be favourable, predicts Somayaji.  When asked, based on Modi's horoscope, about tensions in the Karnataka BJP unit, Dr Jain said, "It will have an impact and cause some worry. But the individual leaders from Karnataka aspiring for the coveted posts will also matter, and a study on this will be shortly conducted,"  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 20 Jul, 4.51 am

However, none of the mosques have been destroyed in such acts of vandalism.  Notably, Jammu and Kashmir government on Thursday while replying to the question of BJP MLA in state parliament said that in the last two decades of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, nearly 208 Hindu temples have been destroyed in various acts of vandalism. "Of the 438 temples in the Valley, 208 had been damaged over the years," it said. The government further said, "A total of 63 hectares of land were under the 436 temples in Kashmir. There was no case of encroachment on these lands so far." "In south Kashmir Kulgam district nearly 85% of the 754 structures have been damaged," government added.  Notably, Srinagar ranks first with 57 temples being destroyed with Anantnag, coming close to second having 56 temples being destroyed by militants. Interestingly, the authorities have kept shut on the cause of such destruction and have been cautious in not blaming the entire episode of vandalism on the militants. On the other hand, Sanjay Tickoo of Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a body of Kashmiri Pandits disputed the government figures, claimed that around 550 temples were damaged and 50,000 canals have been encroached upon.

There's no denying the fact that now after so many years, the serial can't be imagined without main characters Dilip Joshi and Disha Vakani who play Jethalal and Dayaben respectively.  Disha has been missing from the show as earlier she was on maternity leave and after giving birth to a lovely baby girl in September, it is getting difficult for her to manage her professional and personal lives, simultaneously. Earlier during Disha's pregnancy, there were rumours that she would be replaced by Giaa Manek, Gopi Bahu from Saath Nibhaana Saathiya.   However, the makers didn't replace her and shifted their focus on other characters. As Disha plays an important character and she has a huge fan following, it was perceived that her disappearance from the show will affect TRPs but nothing of this sort happened and show did quite well even in her absence.  According to reports, Disha is in no mood to return on the sets as she wants to focus completely on her baby and her married life.  In the meantime, it was reported that Disha might quit the show; however, the producer Asit Modi has completely denied any such news as he said, "The shooting conditions are tough and since Disha's baby is still very young she needs her. We haven't discussed about her return yet and there is no official confirmation on Disha quitting Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashma." "The shooting conditions are tough and since Disha's baby is still very young she needs her. We haven't discussed about her return yet and there is no official confirmation on Disha quitting Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashma."  Once again rumours are doing rounds that Disha may be replaced as it is getting difficult for the makers to continue the show without the character of Dayaben. It seems that there is no clarity as to when Disha will return or whether she will be replaced by Giaa Manek or any other actress. So let's just wait and watch.

Learn more.   Under the Central Government's Act East policy, a great deal of emphasis has been laid on establishing the North East Region (NER) as a viable conduit for trade with Southeast Asia. The construction of the 1360-km long India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway is one such example of how diplomacy is paving the way for the economic transformation of NER. Geopolitical compulsions have robbed the region of any cultural and trade ties that many in the NER shared with their counterparts in Myanmar, China and Southeast Asia. This has left the NER in a state of isolation not only geographically, but also economically. With little industrialisation, ineffective state capacity, excessive dependence on the Central aid, corruption and insurgency-driven civil strife, the region has suffered.  Many commentators from the NER have argued that international trade provides an avenue for the region to break away from its geographical isolation, besides offering opportunities for much-needed investment. One such potential trade route, which has remained inactive for more than seven decades is the little-known Stilwell Road-a strategically important 1,726 km road that connects India and China through Myanmar. Starting from a Ledo, a small town in the Tinsukia district of Assam and home to the easternmost broad-gauge railway station in India, the road traverses through Changla district in Arunachal Pradesh. From there the road cuts across the Pangsau Pass on the Indo-Myanmar border and heads into Patkai province in Myanmar. The road then crosses into China through the town of Wanting in Yunnan province and eventually finishes up in Kunming city. It (Stilwell Road) covers 61 km in India, 1033 km in Myanmar and 632 km in China. "This road has the potential to break the landlocked status of NER. Goods from NER normally pass through the narrow Siliguri Corridor to Kolkata covering about 1600 km and then transhipped again through the Strait of Malacca to Southeast Asia and China. The present route takes nearly seven days for the landing of cargo, whereas the same consignment through Stilwell Road can land in Myanmar and China in less two days," writes Jajati K Patnaik, a noted professor of Political Science.   Built out of necessity  Stilwell Road was constructed in the midst of World War II by the Americans. With the Japanese establishing a sea blockade to China in 1937, and Rangoon falling into their hands in 1942, the Allied Forces led by the United States wanted to construct a road that would act as an alternative supply route. Construction began in October 1942, and by late 1944 it was complete. Under the supervision of General Joseph Warren Stilwell, the road was built by 15,000 US troops, of which nearly two-thirds were African American, and 35,000 local workers, at the cost of US$ 150 million.  This was a remarkable feat of engineering, which also, unfortunately, resulted in the death of 1100 American soldiers and an equal number of local workers. It was on February 11, 1945, when the Americans reached Kunming with a convoy of over 100 army vehicles, and in the process shattering the three-year land blockade the Japanese had set up. Soon after WW-II, however, the road lost its strategic importance. It was named Stilwell after the US general who supervised the construction process.  Barely any trade activity today  Since the end of World War-II, the road has remained inactive, and as a result of subsequent geopolitical events (Partition, Occupation of Tibet and the Indo-China War of '62), mandarins in New Delhi saw little value in it. There is barely any trade activity on this road, besides the barter of goods among people on either side of the Indo-Myanmar border at the Pangsau Pass. Every Friday, both sides celebrate Burma day when villagers are allowed to cross into India. They visit the local markets and buy necessary items, arriving on foot and motorbikes. On the 10th, 20th and 30th of every month, both sides celebrate India Day, when Indian tourists cross into Myanmar. These informal trade melas (fairs) are conducted under the strict supervision of the respective local administrations. Despite the obvious advantages of reopening Stilwell Road for border trade, policy mandarins in New Delhi and security agencies have raised their objections. There are fears that opening this route may fuel the already rampant problem of drug and human trafficking in the region. Security agencies also believe that this route could further facilitate the supply of arms and ammunition to insurgents in the Northeast, besides strengthening operational links between various militant groups. Concerns have also emerged with the Chinese winning the contract to repair the stretch of road running through Myanmar. Those dealing in economic policy have also raised red flags about the potential of Chinese goods making further flooding the Indian market to the detriment of the local industry. Finally, the most significant political hot potato for governments in the NER is the spectre of illegal migration.  "China has shown interest in opening up the route, but India's hesitation is also based on the fact that some part of it involves the contested territory of Arunachal Pradesh. Boundary talks between India and China about the status of Arunachal Pradesh have been going on for years now, with 19 rounds of talks completed in 2016," writes Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, Researcher in International Relations and Politics, Development Studies and Borders, IIT-Guwahati, for The Conversation.  Advantages to opening this road are great  In addition to Moreh in Manipur, which is set to become a vital economic hub in India's trade with Southeast Asia after the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway, a similar case can be made for the township of Margherita near Ledo, from where Stilwell Road actually begins. "Border trade between India and China flows through three border posts: Shipkilia Pass in Himachal Pradesh, Pittorgarh Pass in Uttarakhand, and Nathu-La in Sikkim. Stilwell can reduce transit time and transportation costs of Indo-China trade considerably. It is, indeed a goldmine of possibilities. Various studies conducted on the feasibility of reopening Stilwell Road highlighted that once the road is operational, it will reduce transportation cost between India and China by 30%. Unlike the Nathu-La Pass in Sikkim, the Stilwell Road is capable of handling approximately 25% of India-China bilateral trade," writes , Deputy Director at the Indian Council of Social Science Research, North Eastern Regional Centre (ICSSR), Shillong. If this road goes operational, the NER will have direct access to markets in China, Myanmar and various Southeast Asian countries. As stated earlier, the one can reach Kunming in two days using this road. It will take two and a half days to reach Yangon, the capital city of Myanmar, while Bangkok will take four days and Singapore in five-six days.  In comparison to sea routes, this land route is projected to be shorter and cheaper for international trade. Policymakers in support of reopening this road also believe that this road will bring greater investment into the NER, which will offer it a way out of the current economic malaise. Lest we forget, the value of this road for the tourism industry in the NER will be immense, opening the region up to thousands of tourists every year.  Only if India and China get along  Any attempt at opening this road will only work if both Asian giants establish a workable framework for greater cross-border peace. "The closure of Stilwell Road for the last 60 years has benefited none, not even to the cause of India's security concern. Since road passes through three sovereign countries, the respective governments involved need to ponder over this issue. One should not forget that the reopening of Stilwell Road holds greater promise than perceived. As this road is the only surface link between India and China, a substantial bilateral trade can flow through it besides facilitating closer people-to-people contact. The road should not only be viewed as a trade route but also as a passage for cultural interactions between the two oldest civilisations in Asia," writes C Joshua Thomas. New Delhi should really consider this option. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 01 Mar, 7.42 pm

The flow of water into the lake reduced from 2,000 cusecs to 1,650 cusecs by the evening hours of Tuesday, when the there was a lull in the rains.  The Hussainsagar is not the only lake that is close to overflowing. Official sources say that 50 per cent of the lakes within the GHMC limits are filled to over 70 per cent of their capacity.  Water has reached alarming levels in the Kapra Lake and the Nagaram Cheruvu as well. The zonal commissioner of the east zone visited the fast-filling Kapra Lake to take cognizance of the situation. S. Pankaja, the deputy commissioner of Kapra, said, "At present, there is no danger. But if it rains for the next 24 hours, then lakes in the area may reach full-tank levels."  According to Y.K. Reddy, the IMD chief for Hyderabad, the depression over West Bengal is expected to move towards Chhattisgarh. "In the next 24 hours, we will get slightly more rain than on Tuesday.

After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

The girl, who was seen in the 1.7-minute-long video, is believed to be a resident of Bhadrak district. It appears that the male partner has shot their intimate moments, in the know of the girl. So far, no complaint has been registered with police in this regard. The incident will surely give fresh headache to the cops as the police are still investigating similar cases including the sensational case involving a youth and a girl from Chandbali in Bhadrak district. The youth had allegedly uploaded hundreds of sex videos to various pornographic websites.  Few days later, the youth was found dead on the banks of Kuakhai river here. Concerned over the situation, Odisha police had earlier issued advisory to all the district SPs and public to check circulation of such videos on the internet. "An advisory has been given to all the district SPs and police officers to follow a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with cases right from examining the objectionable images and videos that are going viral on social media platforms till filing the cases," DGP RP Sharma had told after inaugurating a cyber forensic division on the premises of the State Forensic Laboratory here in November last year.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/telugu+post+english-epaper-telpeng/sri+reddy+s+sensational+allegations+against+daggubati+abhiram-newsid-85539980| Movies Sri Reddy's sensational allegations against Daggubati Abhiram | Sti Reddy - This name now needs no introduction. By making allegations against the leading personalities of Telugu film industry, she has caught the attention of the entire Telangana. She has now made sensational allegations against D. Rama Naidu's grandson Suresh Babu's son Daggubati Abhiram. Who is Sri Reddy, Why is she doing this? Sri Reddy began her career as a news reader in Sakshi TV. She had the craze to act in films and hence stepped into the industry. However, like many emerging actors, her film career was not smooth. In the beginning, the industry gave her small roles but later did not show any interest. Hurt by this Sri Reddy declared a war on the Telugu film industry. Initially it was looking like a small publicity stunt but gradually Sri Reddy's accusations have taken the shape of a storm.  She stated that her fight is against casting couch which has become a menace in Tollywood. She added to the sensation by declaring that she will come out with Sri Leaks on the lines of Suchi Leaks. She also shared on Facebook picture of her friend. The picture is not clear and this has sparked talk that she is deliberately doing publicity stunt. People were later shocked to know that the man in the picture is Daggubati Abhiram.  Sri Reddy has made public names of those who had indecent chatting with her on WhatsApp. She also posted screenshots of the chat. The names exposed by her include YouTube Harsha, Indian Idol Shriram, producer Ramesh Poppala, director Koratala Shiva and writer Kona Venkat. She has also named Shekhar Kommula.   The issue took serious turn when she staged strip protest in front of MAA. She had earlier threatened that she will resort to strip protest if justice is not done to her.   Sri Reddy said she is fighting so that others don't have to suffer. She alleged that some influential people were managing media to suppress her fight. She, however, made it clear that nobody can stop her fight. "Due to the political game being played by some big people, several good actors were finished. I am not afraid of threats to my life. I don't care your threats. I may look very small to you but my fight is not small. I will continue the fight," she said while declaring that she will take her fight to the national level. In her latest comment on Facebook, she said chief ministets of the Telugu states should respond.  With the serious allegations levelled against bigwigs of the industry, it appears that industry has crossed the stage where it could have sorted out the issue on its own. Before things go out of control, the government should intervene and order probe into the allegations made by Sri Reddy.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/smartphone+display+confusion+solved+ltps+lcd+vs+ips+lcd+vs+amoled-newsid-69406514| Tech News Smartphone display confusion solved: LTPS LCD vs IPS LCD vs AMOLED | The world of smartphones has been busy from the past few months. There have been numerous revolutionary launches with groundbreaking innovations that have the capacity to change the course of the smartphone industry. But the most important attribute of a smartphone is the display, which has been the focus for all prominent players in the mobile phone industry this year. Samsung came up with its unique 18:5:9 AMOLED display for the Galaxy S8. LG picked up its old trusted IPS LCD unit for the G6's display. These display units have been familiar to the usual Indian smartphone buyer. Honor, on the other hand, has just unveiled the new Honor 8 Pro for the Indian market that ships with an LTPS LCD display. This has led to wonder how exactly is this technology different from the existing ones and what benefits does it give Honor to craft its flagship smartphone with. Well, let's find out.  The LCD technology brought in the era of thin displays to screens, making the smartphone possible in the current world. LCD displays are power efficient and work on the principle of blocking light. The liquid crystal in the display unit uses some kind of a backlight, generally a LED backlight or a reflector, to make the picture visible to the viewer. There are two kinds of LCD units - passive matrix LCD that requires more power and the superior active matrix LCD unit, known to people as Thin Film Transistor (TFT) that draws less power. However, the early LCD technology couldn't maintain the colour for wide angle viewing, which led to the development of the In-Plane Switching (IPS) LCD panel. IPS panel arranges and switches the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules of standard LCD display between the glass substrates. This helps it to enhance viewing angles and improve colour reproduction as well. IPS LCD technology is responsible for accelerating the growth of the smartphone market and is the go-to display technology for prominent manufacturers. The standard LCD display uses amorphous Silicon as the liquid for the display unit as it can be assembled into complex high-current driver circuits. This though restricts the display resolution and adds to overall device temperatures. Therefore, development of the technology led to replacing the amorphous Silicon with Polycrystalline Silicon, which boosted the screen resolution and maintains low temperatures. The larger and more uniform grains of polysilicon allow faster electron movement, resulting in higher resolution and higher refresh rates. It also was found to be cheaper to manufacture due to lower cost of certain key substrates. Therefore, the Low-Temperature PolySilicon (LTPS) LCD screen helps provide larger pixel densities, lower power consumption that standard LCD and controlled temperature ranges. The AMOLED display technology is in a completely different league. It doesn't bother with any liquid mechanism or complex grid structures. The panel uses an array of tiny LEDs placed on TFT modules. These LEDs have an organic construction that directly emits light and minimises its loss by eradicating certain filters. Since LEDs are physically different units, they can be asked to switch on and off as per the requirement of the display to form a picture. This is known as the Active Matrix system. Hence, an Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) display can produce deeper blacks by switching off individual LED pixels, resulting in high contrast pictures. Now, all of that boils down to the final question - which one's better? The honest answer is that it depends on the requirement of the user. If you want accurate colours from your display while wanting it to retain its vibrancy for a longer period of time, then any of the two LCD screens are the ideal choice. LTPS LCD display can provide higher picture resolution but deteriorates faster than standard IPS LCD display over time. An AMOLED display will provide high contrast pictures any time but it too has the tendency to deteriorate faster than LCD panels. Therefore, if you are after greater picture quality, choose LTPS LCD or else settle for AMOLED for a vivid contrast picture experience. Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 24 Jun, 7.39 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/here+are+five+major+controversies+that+rocked+dileep+s+life-newsid-70303960| Home Here are five major controversies that rocked Dileep's life |   Actor Dileep is currently facing serious trouble. The superstar has been implicated in the recent abduction and assault of a leading Malayalam actress, and police have arrested him for alleged conspiracy in the attack.   The actor has been accused of being the mastermind behind the actress' abduction case. Police claim that he paid the main accused Pulsar Suni and his cronies to orchestrate the crime. Within a day of Dileep's arrest, he was evicted from AMMA and FEFKA - which are the big film organisations in Mollywood. The investigation is ongoing.  A few days ago, director Vinayan called him a 'master manipulator' who made 'puppets' out of Mammootty and Mohanlal, while one scriptwriter had him a 'peeping tom'. On the other hand, Dileep, in his statement, claimed that people in the Malayalam film industry were out to take revenge on him by trapping him in the case.   Here are five of the biggest controversies Dileep was involved in his three-decade-old career.    The AMMA and MACTA war:      The infamous AMMA - MACTA war happened a few years back, and resulted in the creation of a parallel organisation to that of MACTA, the directors' organisation. According to reports, it all began when Dileep walked out of a movie called Kuttananadan Express, while insisting that director Tulasidas be replaced with another one.  Later, Tulasidas lodged a complaint with MACTA - who promptly banned the actor from working in Malayalam movies. However, AMMA, which is Dileep's organisation, backed him and this led to one of the biggest stalemates in the industry.   Nishal Chandra-Kavya Madhavan divorce :     There were rumours that Dileep was in a relationship with actress Kavya Madhavan and this was the prime reason for her divorce. Kavya was married to a businessman Nishal Chandra on February 9, 2009, after which she moved to Kuwait. However, she returned home in June the same year and filed for divorce on July 2010. The divorce was granted on 30 May 2011. While she accused her ex-in-laws of mentally and physically torturing her, they blamed Kavya's closeness to Dileep for breaking the marriage. The rumor mills in Kerala, naturally went on overdrive.    Dileep-Manju Warrier divorce:     Soon after the news of Kavya and Nischal's divorce, there where were speculations that Dileep and actress Manju Warrier's wedding would also face trouble. These rumours came came true when the duo filed for divorce and the court granted them the same. Among the many allegations rumour-mongers spread at the time was that Dileep was not happy with Manju making a comeback in acting and hence decided to go their separate ways. Dileep was granted the custody of their daughter Meenakshi. However, Dileep's proximity to Kavya Madhavan was also claimed to be the prime reason for the split.  Dileep and Kavya's wedding:      This became the biggest news of the year in Kerala. Dileep and Kavya got married on November 5, 2016 at Vedanta Hotel, Kochi. Many famous celebs from Mollywood attended the wedding - including Mammootty, Menaka Suresh, Jomol, Srinda, Meera Jasmine and Jayaram. According to reports, the wedding was kept a secret till hours before the ceremony. Speaking to the media after the wedding, Dileep said, "Kavya was not the reason for whatever problems that happened in my family. So I decided if I were going to get married, I will marry someone who was made a scapegoat for my problems. In the last couple of days, I discussed with my family and daughter about this wedding. And today I am marrying Kavya with their full backing."  Dileep arrested in actress abduction case:     This is the biggest controversy that Dileep has found himself - since it has led to his arrest. On February 17, a Malayalam actress was travelling from Thrissur to Kochi in her car when she was abducted and sexually assaulted by several unknown men. The police probe team arrested Pulsar Suni and his aides, who effected the kidnapping, a week after the incident. The conspiracy angle surfaced later and Dileep and his close aide, actor-turned-director Nadirshah, were questioned for 13 hours on June 28. Finally, based on the evidence that they have gathered, the police arrested Dileep on Monday, and he was sent to judicial custody. While the police claim he is involved in the conspiracy, the actor insists that he is innocent.  Dailyhunt	|Friday, 14 Jul, 12.29 pm

"I'm obviously a cricket tragic and a huge Sachin fan," Theja told BuzzFeed.     image source  "I've never been thirsted on in my life (that I know of lol). I never expected this reaction," he added. It's not all been smooth sailing for Theja, though. "My mates are getting a huge kick out of the reactions. The more inappropriate the better for them." And it's not just Theja Surapaneni who's being troubled persistently by admirers. Host Tom Gleeson stated, "I've never seen a reaction like it before. I've had people on my Facebook and Twitter hounding me for his details." "We have had attractive people on our show before but not like Theja. He was so attractive it almost broke the quiz show. It was hard to concentrate," Gleeson said. For what it's worth, Theja isn't hugely active on social media. "I'm not narcissistic enough to think people are interested in what I do. But I better plug where I work, I might as well get some more patients haha!" Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 29 Mar, 2.26 pm

Arpita Khan Sharma, who considered as the most loved sister of 'Khandaan.' We have always seen Salman Khan and his family shower love and care on this 28-year-old daughter of their family. The entire fans of Bollywood admire the Khandaan for being such a sweet family. Arpita Khan Sharma who turned 28 on August 1, despite never being a part of Hindi Films, has always been a popular name among the fans of Bollywood. She has always been the talk of the town, for all the good reasons of course. Arpita who is the youngest sister of Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail Khan, is very close to her brother and especially an apple of Salman's eye. When the news of Arpita wedding with her longtime boyfriend Ayush Sharma surfaced, it made it to the headlines of all the leading newspapers, mags and channels.  Needless to say, that when it came to his adorable sister Arpita's wedding, Salman and the entire 'Khandaan' didn't leave a stone unturned to make it a fairytale one. So, on this auspicious occasion of Rakhi, we are here to tell you something about the most fortunate sister of tinsel town. Here are some lesser-known facts about Arpita Khan Sharma's life, we bet you didn't know.  Arpita was born on August 1, 1989. Despite not being a biological daughter of Salim Khan, she has always been the most loved member of their family.   It is said that Arpita was adopted by Salman's parents Salim and Salma Khan. There are different stories around in the media, around her adoption.   While some say that Arpita's mother was a beggar and lived on a footpath. She died right after giving birth to Arpita. And Salim and Salma spotted this infant near her dead body on the footpath they were passing by. Hence, they brought her home along and decided to make her a part of their family forever.   The reports in the media also state that Salim's second wife Helen was the one who adopted Arpita. This is how Arpita became an Angel from an orphan.  Very few people know that Arpita has really got a great fashion sense. She is a fashion graduate from London College Of Fashion and holds a degree in fashion marketing and management.   Before Arpita got married to Ayush Sharma, she used to work for an architectural and interior designing firm. This Beti of 'Khandaan' dreams of owning her own fashion brand one day.  In the year 2014, Arpita got a tattoo of a star, which contains the names of all her family members. The tattoo has got Salim Khan, mothers Salma and Helen, brothers Salman, Arbaaz. Sohail, sister Alvira and friend Deeksha.   This isn't much known that when Arpita dated Arjun Kapoor for two years. When Arpita and Arjun were in a relationship Arjun weighed 140 Kgs. But fate had some other plans for this couple. Arjun and Arpita broke up and the reason for their split is still not known. Seems like their break up didn't affect Arjun's terms with Khandaan and especially Salman Khan, Coz he is still close to that family.  Once again, cupid struck Arpita when she met Delhi based businessman, Ayush Sharma. Ayush hails from Delhi and belongs to a royal family. Unlike Arpita, Ayush has got plans to make Bollywood debut soon.  Arpita's wedding with Ayush Sharma is considered as the most expensive wedding of B-town. If the reports are to be believed, Arpita always wanted to get married in a palace. Ergo, Salman who can make all possible efforts to make his sister's wish come true booked the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad for her wedding. Her fairytale wedding was a Star studded affair.  Arpita is now happily married to Ayush and gave birth to a baby, Ahil, in March 2016. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 14 Aug, 6.41 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/inc42-epaper-inc/somveer+anand+on+an+agritech+mission+to+bring+concept+of+urban+farming+in+india+with+startup+pindfresh-newsid-85400025| News Somveer Anand On An Agritech Mission To Bring Concept Of Urban Farming In India With Startup Pindfresh | Food today is laden with chemical fertilisers that cause some major health risks such as cancer. Fertilisers such as ammonium nitrate, cadmium, potassium chloride, organophosphate (OP), pyrethroids, etc. are used to protect vegetables against pest and premature decay. Despite the apparent impact on health, the irony is that India is now the second largest manufacturer of pesticides in Asia after China and ranks twelfth globally. "It was the importance of clean and healthy food dawned upon us. Bringing farming to the urban Indian homes, and making people aware of what they eat is the mission behind setting up Pindfresh," says Somveer Anand , founder of agritech startup Pindfresh.  For Somveer and his wife Sohila Anand, the idea to launch Pindfresh was very much based on a personal experience that he had after one of his close relative fell ill due to the consumption of chemical-loaded food. During their India visit the husband-wife duo had an hands-on experience on the extreme dearth of hygienic, nutritious food in India and this is where, they also felt, there was a dire need to provide people with the ability to grow vegetables locally. That's precisely where the Pindfresh's journey began 2016, when they were also joined in by Jaspal Singh Anand. The agritech startup Pindfresh is turning small plots or spaces between buildings or in buildings into usable farm space. From rooftop gardens, to floors specifically designed to incorporate farming, to other spaces within high-rises filled with racks of perfectly lined leaf vegetables, it is striving to bring about a farming revolution in urban India.  Apart from selling in-house home systems (hydroponic and others) and fresh produce (lettuce, rocket, basil and mushrooms), it also runs programmes to train people (in schools and societies). By using hydroponics, cocopeat gardening and other soilless techniques, Pindfresh is attempting to educate urban dwellers to use a technology which takes less space, demands lesser water and is completely free from pathogens and biological contaminants.  Organic Farming: Ushering In Organic Food Revolution   The concept of urban farming is a trend that is catching up fast globally. For instance, Tokyo-based Kono Designs started an urban farm by the name of Pasona in a nine-storey building in 2010, and this gave the employees a chance to grow and harvest their own food at work. Apart from Pasona, major companies in Japan like Mitsubishi are also leading the way to set up urban farms at their offices. Japan has become a front runner in urban farming, which is in turn helping the country cut food import costs.  India too needs to plant the idea of urban farming. Why? Here is the reason.  The urban population in India, which stands at 377 Mn, is expected to reach 600 Mn by 2031, according to a new UN-backed report. The increasing nutritional requirements of this fast-growing urban population will pose a huge challenge in the coming years. Due to the ever-increasing urban population and decreasing rural population that used to tend to frame as a traditional occupation, India imported $906.3 Mn (INR 5,897 Cr) worth of fruit and vegetables in 2016-17, while the figure in 2014-15 was $832 Mn (INR 5,414 Cr). As a result, Indian consumers are becoming victims of processed food as there is a wide gap in the supply and demand chain. To address this problem, there is a subtle movement that is taking place in India over urban farming, spearheaded by millennials. Of these, integrating farming ideas into the urban space is also Pindfresh.  As far as India is concerned, a survey on the Status of Organic Farming in India was conducted by scientists from different universities including the Indian Institute of Soil Science to ascertain the real benefits and feasibility of organic farming in terms of the production potential, economics and soil health, in comparison to the conventional farms in India. The study revealed that organic farming, in spite of the reduction in crop productivity by 9.2%, resulted in an increase of 22% in the farmers' net profit compared to conventional farming. This trend got further escalated with the coming of urban farming and today, agritech startups are not only helping farmers to assess the soil and weather conditions or crop production but are also coming up with unique ideas to optimise the limited space in urban India to grow vegetation in offices and other commercial complexes. And the best part is that the idea of organic farming is not limited to just offices; balconies, roofs, terraces, drawing rooms and kitchens in urban homes but could be seen as a future of vegetation in urban India and Pindfresh is determined to make it a reality with its advanced organic farming techniques.   Pindfresh And Their Concrete Vegetable Farms   Pindfresh's journey began with an initial capital of $7.68K (INR 5 Lakh). When the agritech startup was taking shape, the trio did a lot of research to learn about hydroponics and then tailor make it to suit the Indian conditions (or rather, that of any developing nation).    "For example, we try and promote hydroponics where the space requirements are important. For places we have no space constraint, we try and promote coco peat gardening in grow bags and feed them using hydroponic nutrients. Not being wedded to a particular technology allows us the freedom to experiment and recommend the most appropriate ways of growing our food," says Somveer. But this agritech technology or perhaps trend is soon catching up across India today.  Here is a look at how hydroponics and soilless farming is evolving in India.   According to a research pursued by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, the area under hydroponics began to expand significantly in Europe and Asia during the 1950s and 1960s, and large hydroponic systems were developed in the deserts of California, Arizona, Abu Dhabi and Iran (1970). The research elaborates that hydroponics did not reach India until 1946. By 2008, localised experiments were adopted to grow exotic crops like strawberry, green garlic and tomatoes. Today, 'Landmark Agrotech' project is the second biggest hydroponics project in Gujarat and is currently under implementation. Likewise, for Pindfresh, all the growing is done at their prototype growing facility in Nayagaon, Punjab.     Startup Pindfresh Making Systems To Flourish 'Mini Pinds'   The startup is attempting to make cities holistic in their requirements of food and vegetation. To that end, it is working towards creating systems by which people will actually eat the local and fresh produce - just as if the food is coming directly from the Pind. Essentially, they offer three services: creating and selling systems for home and commercial use; producing food using Pindfresh systems and selling it and holding workshops. The startup is grossing over a monetisation strategy that involves making the vegetable saplings available for procurement by offices and houses. They have two types of customers: one who buys the plants to grow the vegetables themselves and those who only buy the vegetables. Pindfresh is also selling to wholesale markets. "Traditionally, cities have sourced all their food and supplies from the surrounding villages. The reason why we call ourselves Pindfresh is because we want to move the production of food from the villages to the cities. We want to create mini pinds (villages) in the centre of the towns and in every household!" Somveer enumerates. The startup is planning to develop an app which can advise customers on the right way and time to water the plants, add nutrients, check the pH of the water, etc.  The Road To Augur In An Organic Revolution Via Agritech  In the two years of growing leafy vegetables and building the organic 'farm to fork' concept for the urban landscape, agritech startup Pindfresh has seen quite a number of challenges. "The major challenge we had initially was a complete lack of an agri startup ecosystem in Chandigarh (which was surprising, considering its the gateway to Punjab, the 'Bread Basket of India'. The other problems that we faced included sourcing specialised materials and equipment (that we needed to make our hydroponic equipment with) and customer education but made us realise that a HUGE opportunity existed here," highlights Somveer. Despite the challenges, the agritech startup has been well on the path of exploring the opportunity as their traction shows. It has a top line of about $6.14K (INR 4 Lakh) a month (growing at 20% M-o-M). Sold more than a 1,000 units over the last 12 months Chandigarh and Delhi are its two major traction areas As urban farming is fairly a new idea in India, Pindfresh is shaping itself to become a robust sustainable agritech startup to lead the industry amidst many people who deal with home-grown balcony systems and hydroponics. Organisations like City Farming, Earthoholics, Fresh & Local, Urban Leaves, etc. are its likely competitors. According to Somveer, "This industry has a lot of scope of becoming a rage. The main reason behind it is that it is aimed at our well-being, and health, which are the burning topics of discourse these days."    He adds, "It is well suited to the modern day lifestyle, where we are living in smaller spaces, with even lesser time to devote. Hydroponic and soilless systems are easier to maintain, requiring on an average of 30 mins a week - produce wonderful and nutritional food and flowers, are modular and DIY in nature and most importantly will not break the bank once you start!" The agritech startup is aiming to introduce consistent innovations to grow and aid to the development of urban farms in India. On the latest innovation the company is working on, Somveer mentions, "We're always thinking about how we can use hydroponics to solve other real-world problems. So, we 'invented' the Niño. The Niño is a unique vertical system (the first of its kind in India) and apart from being easy on the pocket, is very low on maintenance as well! This system can hold up to 36 air cleaning plants, looks beautiful in being placed in a corner and it not only removes formaldehyde, acetone, NOx's and COx's, etc. from the room, it also releases fresh oxygen for us to breathe and work in a healthy environment." As for the way ahead, Somveer avers that they are currently toying with the idea of raising a little bit of money for the R&D and for inventory, but prefers an investor who understands the space. The startup says it will need about $307,600 (INR 2 Cr) to roll out its rooftop system for growing plants (and that doubles as a nursery for their farmers). The founders plan to use the funds for the development of sensors and IoT systems that can predict how much food will be required at what time, what the growing conditions are going to be in the future and how much of the produce must be consumed to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  The Green Of The Future   In countries like Israel and the US, hydroponic produce is already part of the market, which is yet to happen in India. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon is perhaps one of the earliest examples of hydroponics. Urban farming, especially in the case of India, can play a significant role in urban environmental management as it can combat urban heat island effects and enhance the quality of air, besides offering organic, fertiliser-free produce. The Food and Agricultural Organization has long since recognised urban agriculture as a key element in food security strategies. However, a formal recognition of urban agriculture and its integration into the urban planning process are necessary for it to be successful. In India, urban agriculture is being carried out in many cities including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai under the leadership of the government, private agencies or even individuals. Considering the wave of organic revolution that it can ignite, startups like Pindfresh may go a long way in equipping India to meet its future food demands.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

As Bizzare as it may sound but a boy in Florida accidently impregnated 16 girls when they were having a party. While the nation is in a deep shock to learn this incident, it is being widely reported by the media all over the world. The boy is a 15-year-old African American resident of Florida.    Meeting During the Party of a Friend   Meeting During the Party of a Friend All the students are of school going age. They decided to throw a surprise party for their mutual friend, Daliah Jennings. Darla Jennings was surprised at the party which was thrown for her birthday. The birthday party had food and soft drinks but the special attraction was a pool party. The pool was where all the action began!     How did they Get Pregnant?   How did they Get Pregnant? The 15-year-old boy did not have any physical relations with any of the girls present at the party. The boy only once ejaculated into the pool and that did all the things. Most of the girls were in the pool at that time when the boy ejaculated. As weird as it may sound, but the boy's sperm is 1000 times more potent than an average human sperm.    The Boy's Sperm is 1000 times more Potent: Scientists   The Boy's Sperm is 1000 times more Potent Scientists Dr. John Suzukima from Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Hospital has given the reason for this bizarre happening:- "Clinical tests have proven that people who suffer from spermafortis have sperm counts close to a thousand times more potent and rich in spermatozoids than the average man. This kind of semen is fairly similar to that of common water mammals, such as dolphins, manatees and seals and has properties that make it incredibly resistant to water. This condition could definitely explain what happened in this case but clinical trials and further tests would be needed to prove this theory."    The Boy had no Idea about his Condition   The Boy had no Idea about his Condition The 15-year-old young guy claimed that he didn't get physically involved with anyone in the party and he just ejaculated in the pool by mistake. This is what he had to say about the incident, "Some people in town say we had some kind of wild s*x orgy going on and that's how I got all those girls pregnant, but I'm proud to say that I am still a virgin and that if anyone doesn't believe me, I'm ready to undergo medical examination to prove it if that's what it takes."    Birthday Girl Escaped Pregnancy   Birthday Girl Escaped Pregnancy The birthday girl, Daliah Jennings for whom the party was thrown is very happy that she escaped pregnancy. In her words, "I'm glad I didn't have my swimsuit that day. It was a surprise party to celebrate my 15th birthday, let's just say that a baby in my womb is the kind of present I'm glad I didn't get."    The Fate of Pregnant Girls   The Fate of Pregnant Girls Most of the 16 girls are scheduled to undergo an abortion although two of the impregnated girls' families have reportedly admitted that they have decided to bring the birth to the babies as they are devout Christians and against the taking of an innocent life.                     By the way, many Wesites have published it and claimed it to be fake story. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 16 Oct, 10.49 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/youngisthan-epaper-youngeng/why+lord+krishna+never+married+radha-newsid-74055101|  Home Why Lord Krishna Never Married Radha | Radha and Krishna - Without Radha, Krishna is incomplete and without Krishna, Radha cannot be complete. Modern-day couples have been inspired by the eternal love story of Radha and Krishna. Even after so many eras, heavenly couple Radha-Krishna is worshipped together not only by youths but by everyone. With Krishna, Radha is considered to be the supreme goddess as she is said to command Lord Krishna. Listening to krishna and radha enchanting love story, many of the devotees end up thinking why Lord Krishna never married Radha.    According to various researches and studies conducted, it is said that Lord Krishna never married Radha as he believed; love and marriage are two different things. According to the Vedas, Krishna believed that marriage is an agreement or arrangement while love is a selfless emotion where you pledge to love someone with purified nature. Radha and Krishna love story is an exemplary for teens where he says marriage is materialistic.  Furthermore, Radha was in love with Krishna so much that she believed Krishna was God and she used to love him as a devotee. She was lost in 'bhakti love' which people started mistaking as a physical love. Radha and Krishna love is taken as a relationship between a devotee and God.     Radha and Krishna are not separate  According to the facts believed, Radha is not separate from Krishna. Lord Krishna has various types of energies and you need two individuals to get married. Also, Radha is Lord Krishna's energy which pleases him. Therefore it is believed that Radha and Krishna are two different manifestations of the divine principle.    In order to show that Radha and Krishna relationship was not physical but it was actually the eminent level of love between the two, Lord Krishna did not marry Radha. It is said that it was the highest devotion of love expressed by a human (Radha) to Lord Krishna (The God). According to the Vedic scriptures, the love shared between Radha and Krishna cannot be compared to any other mythological or love stories from history. One more story supports the idea which says Radha refused to marry Krishna because she felt she doesn't fit in the place. According to Radha, people would never want Lord Krishna to marry a cowgirl. They would surely want Lord Krishna to marry a princess. However, Lord Krishna reassured Radha about the marriage and her status in the society, but she was firm in her decision. Also, there is one more theory which says that because Krishna and Radha are one soul, Krishna says that how can he marry his own soul. He explained the world that Krishna and Radha are one and not different from each other in existence or spirit. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 29 Sep, 12.35 pm

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/10+cars+with+high+resale+value+from+toyota+fortuner+xuv500+to+maruti+alto-newsid-84028489| CarToq 10 cars with high resale value: From Toyota Fortuner & XUV500 to Maruti Alto | It's said that the used car market is more than twice the size of the new car market in India. There are many who go the used car way to drive home a model of their choice whilst saving a considerable amount by not buying a brand-new car. Well, it surely makes sense to buy a sparingly used and a well-maintained car instead of a new one, especially if you take into account the money you can save. However, here are a few cars that retain their value pretty well. While sellers of these cars benefit from the high resale, the buyers generally don't mind spending a bit extra for the reliability and/or ease of maintenance these cars offer.  Toyota Fortuner Akin to the earlier generation, the new Fortuner has been a great hit with the premium SUV-buyers in India. Even in the used car market, the Fortuner is a very popular model, which sells in good numbers in spite of the relatively higher price it commands. Much of this is due to its brand image and Toyota's best-in-class after-sales support. Seen above is a 2017 Toyota Fortuner 2.8 4×2 MT that's going for Rs 31 lakh on one of the e-commerce websites. A new one costs Rs 32.74 lakh (on-road). The SUV has run for less than 9,000 kms, which makes it almost as good as new. Plus, you save more than a lakh rupees. Mahindra XUV500    The Mahindra XUV500 is another SUV that's as popular in the used car market as it is in the new car space. Much of this is due to the bold design, powerful engine, comfortable cabin, and Mahindra's wide service network. A new Mahindra XUV500 W6 AT costs Rs 17.84 lakh (on-road). However, here is a used XUV500 W6 AT going for Rs 15.85 lakh. While it's less than Rs 2 lakh of difference, you get less-than-a-year-old car that has run just 9,000 kms. The seller, on the other hand, benefits from a low depreciation rate. Renault Kwid    The Renault Kwid is another car that enjoys a pretty high resale value. The Kwid is a pretty popular car as it offers a spacious cabin, frugal engines, and ease of maintenance. Hence, it's a popular choice even in the used car market. Here is a used Renault Kwid RxL that's on sale for Rs 3.25 lakh. In comparison, a new one costs Rs 3.8 lakh. So, you end up saving Rs 55,000 by buying a car that is less than a year old and has run less than 5,000 kms. Hyundai Elite i20    The Elite i20 is the only hatchback from Hyundai that retains its value pretty well. Here is a used 2015 Hyundai Elite i20 Magna Kappa petrol model that has run less than 30,000 kms and is on sale for Rs 5.25 lakh. In comparison, a new one costs Rs 6.58 lakh. So it's a depreciation of around 20% in more than 2 years. Maruti Baleno    The new Maruti Baleno is another premium B-segment hatchback that enjoys a high resale value. Seen here is a used 2016 Maruti Baleno 1.2 Delta petrol model that is on sale for Rs 5.75 lakh. A new one costs Rs 6.52 lakh (on road). So, basically, this car has depreciated by less than 10% even after more than a year and 15,000 kms of running. Amazing! Hyundai Creta    The Creta is a highly popular SUV from Hyundai. It enjoys a very high popularity in both new and used car market. Thanks to the high demand, its resale value witnesses less-than-usual depreciation. Here is a used 2016 Hyundai Creta SX AT Diesel model that is going for Rs 13.75 lakh. A new one costs Rs 17.2 lakh. So, that's around 20% depreciation in more than two years. Not bad! Honda City    The Honda City enjoys a very high brand image in India. No surprise, then, that it ends up having a high resale value in the used car market. Here is a used 2016 Honda City that has been listed at Rs 8.95 lakh. The car is over 2 years old and has run 9,000 kms. A new one costs Rs 10.86 lakh. Maruti Swift    While the second-generation Swift is no longer available, it's still a popular model in the used car market. Here's a used 2015 Maruti Suzuki Swift that is on sale for Rs 5.5 lakh. A new one went for roughly Rs 6.75 lakh on road. So it's a depreciation of roughly 20% in more than 3 years! Maruti Ciaz    Another really popular mid-size sedan that enjoys a great resale value is the Maruti Ciaz. Here's a used 2015 Maruti Suzuki Ciaz ZXi AT that has been listed at Rs 7.49 lakh. The car has run almost 53,000 kms. In comparison, a new one costs Rs 11 lakh on road. Maruti Alto    The Alto is another small car that enjoys. a huge popularity. Thanks to the trust that comes associated with owning a Maruti, cheap spares, a wide service network, and a high mileage, the Alto commands a pretty high resale value. Here's a used 2013 Maruti Alto 800 LXi that has been listed at Rs 1.80 lakh. A new one costs Rs 3.1 lakh on road. Basically, it's around 40% depreciation in more than 5 years!

In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history. It is safe to say that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the event.  A bloodied Reigns lost to Lesnar But amidst all this, something unfortunate happened. WWE star Natalya suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction during the event. After being thrown out of the rind during women's Battle Royal, she fell on the floor in an uncompromising position.

Yes, it was Arijit's live concert yesterday and he treated us to some heart-melting tracks yesterday. What surprised us is that he sang Salman's song "Dil Diyan Gallan", which was originally sung by Atif Aslam.    When given a choice, Salman had chosen Atif over Arijit for this particular song. But there are no doubts about the fact that Arijit sung it exceptionally well.   Two reasons why Arijit chose that song in his concert.   There are 2 reasons for this song choice; firstly, Arijit must have thought to make peace with Salman Khan by singing this song. Secondly, Arijit might be wanting to prove that he's a better singer than Atif Aslam.  The song certainly won hearts & you can't miss the video;  "Galti maaf krna only fan moment".#ArijitSingh #Aadeez #AtifASLAM @raiisonai @itsaadee pic.twitter.com/lBAnBhghrD— Bilal Aadeez.

As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/business+world-epaper-bizworld/tax+free+gratuity+ceiling+raised+to+rs+20+lakh-newsid-84668054| News Tax-free gratuity ceiling raised to Rs 20 lakh |  The government today notified doubling of the limit of tax-free gratuity to Rs 20 lakh in private sector. The notification follows changes in the Payment of Gratuity Act which had empowered the government to fix the ceiling of the retirement benefit through an executive order. The amendment bill approved by Parliament earlier in the month had also empowered the government to fix the period of maternity leave. Accordingly, the central government has fixed the total period of maternity leave in the case of a female employee to 26 weeks. After implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission, the ceiling of tax-free gratuity amount for the central government employees was increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The unions have been demanding for inclusion of the change in the Payment of Gratuity Act.  So far, formal sector workers with five or more years of service are eligible for Rs 10 lakh tax-free gratuity after leaving job or at time of superannuation. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, was enacted to provide for gratuity payment to employees engaged in factories, mines, oilfields, plantations, ports, railway companies, shops or other establishments. The law is applicable to employees, who have completed at least five years of continuous service in an establishment that has 10 or more persons. The change with respect to maternity leaves comes against the backdrop of the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, enhancing the maximum maternity leave period to 26 weeks.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news+karnataka-epaper-newskarn/yelahanka+bjp+candidate+has+to+work+hard+in+2018-newsid-72222920| Top News Yelahanka: BJP candidate has to work hard in 2018 |  Bengaluru: Yelahanka is one among the 12 Assembly constituencies represented by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the State Assembly. While Congress candidates represent 13 Assembly segments, three Janata Dal (Secular) candidates have won from the remaining three Assembly constituencies. And among the three JD(S) MLAs, two have been identified as the dissidents who are set to join Congress in December and contest to the Assembly from their respective constituencies next year. Once, Yelahanka, a reserved constituency, was considered as Congress fortress. Its candidates won seven times from this constituency. While late Basava Lingappa represented Yelahanka in the State Assembly for three times (1978, 1985 and 1989) his son B Prasanna Kumar got elected twice (1999 and 2004) as a Congress candidate. With the Election Commission reserving Yelahanka for general candidates, BJP candidate S.R. Vishwanath got elected twice (2008 and 2013) from this constituency.  Vishwanath defeated Congress candidate B. Chandrappa with a margin of 16,022 votes in 2008. Vishwanath got polled 60,975 votes while Chandrappa managed to get 44,953 votes. However, Chandrappa defected to the JD(S) from Congress to contest from Yelahanka in 2013. Though Chandrappa got more votes (57110) as the JD(S) candidate in 2013, BJP candidate Vishwanath romped home with more votes (75,507). He defeated Chandrappa with a margin of 18,397 votes while Congress candidate Gopala Krishna M.N. was relegated to the third position with 26.7 per cent of votes (52,372). The voters of Yelahanka attribute proactive attitude of the present incumbent's success in the elections. They opine that nothing can stop him romping home again in the Assembly elections scheduled for the next year. "We are happy with MLA Vishwanath's initiative in taking up developmental works. We never forget his help when the BBMP authorities launched the demolition of buildings allegedly built on the storm water drain,'' Jyothi Prakash, a resident of Yelahanka Satellite Town, said. The residents said they find no hassles whenever they want to meet their elected representative. They said MLA Vishwanath played a key role in rejuvenating and developing Allalasandra Lake. "He, in association with the Urban Development Department and the BBMP, has organised Allalasandra Lake Festival. It was a great success. Yelahanka Satellite Town is known for having a number of parks,'' opines Shanthamma Gowda, a resident of Allalasandra. It is not that there are no residents who are unhappy with the MLA. There are voters who opine that winning in the next Assembly election may not be a bed of roses for the present incumbent. They cite the example of his wife Vanishree's defeat in the BBMP elections held in 2015. Vanishree contested from Chowdeshwari ward which was won by BJP corporator K.V. Yashodha in 2010. Congress candidate defeated Vanishree with a margin of more than 3,000 votes. "I don't think Vishwanath to win in the next Assembly elections. How can you expect him to get elected when he was not able to ensure the win of his wife in his own constituency,'' said S. Ramakrishna, a resident of Chowdeswari Nagar. There are four BBMP wards in Yelahanka Assembly constituency. While three wards - Kempegowda, Attur, and Yelahanka Satellite Town - are represented by the BJP corporators such as ChandrammaKempegowda, Nathra Pallavi M, and Satheesh M, one ward - Chowdeswari - is represented by Congress corporator R Padmavathi. There are 2,75,875 voters in Yelahanka Assembly constituency and among them, 1,42,517 are male voters and 1,33,333 are female voters. All in all, Vishwanath cannot afford to be negligent in the next Assembly elections. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 24 Aug, 11.34 am

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/was+lord+hanuman+really+a+brahmachari-newsid-72245649| History & Religion Was Lord Hanuman Really A Brahmachari? |  How many times did he marry?   Ramayan and Mahabharat, the two main Hindu mythological writings, tell us stories about ancient India. From Vedas to Puranas, our beliefs and assumptions have been based on their various versions found across India.  Our elders have been telling us the great stories from the mythological tale of the Ramayana. But many versions of them leave us in a state of confusion. One such story we talk about is about great Lord Hanuman or Mahabali Hanuman.  Most of us know about his love and selfless devotion to his master Lord Rama. We also know about his pledge to stay away from the worldly pleasures and live a life of Brahmacharya - a life without marital relations.  That is what we know or we might have heard. But is it true? Was Lord Hanuman really a Brahmachari and didn't marry? Or did he?  Several theories prevail about it.  He is considered as the ideal combination of ultimate strength, heroic initiative and assertive excellence. He is known for love, emotional devotion to Lord Rama. Besides being a popular deity in Hinduism, he also finds mention in Jainism and Buddhism.   Source   As Hanuman grew, his mother told him to get educated. There is no better teacher than Surya, the Sun god, who dispels all darkness. So following his mother's orders, Lord Hanuman reached Surya Mandala and humbly prayed to the Sun god to impart education. From Sun god, he learned Vedas, Vedangas, and Upangas.   By the time he had gained all the knowledge, he was ready to graduate. He bowed to Lord Surya and thanked him for educating him. He offered to give Lord Surya a Guru Dakshina. It is believed that Lord Surya asked him to marry his daughter Suvarchala as a Guru Dakshina.   He studied the Vedas and mastered the Nine Vyakarnas. Being a born celibate, Lord Hanuman was not eligible to study the Nava Vyakarnas (nine grammars) for which becoming a Grihastha (married man) was essential. In order to facilitate the completion of his education, Surya Bhagwan created a beautiful daughter Suvarchala Devi, from the Sun rays and arranged a marriage with Hanuman to make him a Grahasth.   Source    Source  Hanuman reminded Lord Surya about his resolve to follow Brahmacharya through out his life. In this pursuit, Hanuman received the boon from Sun god that he would remain a Brahmachari even after marriage. The Sun god told him that the marriage is only for the welfare of the Universe and it would not affect his chosen course of celibacy.   There is a temple in Andhra Pradesh that has the idols of Lord Hanuman with his wife. It is believed that the idols are that of Lord Hanuman and his wife Suvarchala and together they are known as Suvarchala Anjaneya.   Source   Hanuman obeyed his Guru and married Suvarchala. It is stated in PARASARA SAMHITA that Surya offered his daughter Suvarchala in marriage on JYESTHA SUDDHA DASAMI. It was a Wednesday. Those who follow this tradition, even to this day, observe "HANUMAT KALYANAM" (Hanuman's Marriage) on JYESTHA SUDDHA DASAMI.   Source   Jainism has another version of the story. According to Jain literature, Hanuman is not a celibate. He married princess Anangakusuma, the daughter of Kharadushana and Ravana's sister Chandranakha. Ravana also presented Hanuman one of his nieces as a second wife.   Source   When Hanuman took a dip in the waters of the sea after burning whole of Lanka, a drop of his sweat fell in mouth of a mighty fish. As a result, the Makardhwaja was born.   Source   According to other versions of the Ramayana, Macchanu is the son of Hanuman borne by Suvannamaccha, daughter of Ravana. The Jain text Paumacariya also mentions that Hanuman married Lankasundari, the daughter of Lanka's chief defender Bajramukha.   Source   Born with the boon of an eternal life, Lord Hanuman is an embodiment of truth, faith, knowledge, courage, and righteousness. It is also said that any body who worships Hanuman would be free from the ill effects of planetary alignments.   Source   Worshipped by many to gain courage and strength in their lives, Lord Hanuman is the ultimate symbol of devotion. The strange yet the pure form of innocence he had in him since his childhood. Lord Hanuman is the highest and perfect example of strength, devotion, and perseverance.   He was born to Anjana (also known as Anjani) who was 'a vanara' princess and father Kesari, a 'vanara' chief. Several Hindu texts consider him as an incarnation of Lord Shiva. He is also regarded as the son of the wind-god Pawan, who according to several stories, played a role in his birth.   It is said that after the war in Lanka, Hanuman proceeded to The Himalayas to continue his worship of Lord Ram. He etched his version of Ram's tale on the walls of Himalayan caves with his nails.   Every coin has two different sides. The same is the case with mythology. We have heard about it from our ancestors but haven't seen it in real. Nobody is taking a side but just bringing in light whatever was hidden.  Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 24 Aug, 6.20 pm

But many women fail to pay much attention to their boobs which trouble them in a long time. As breasts are the most delicate parts of our body, we need to take special care of them. Throughout the day, we do many things, knowingly and unknowingly, that can cause great harm to our boobs. From wearing the wrong size of bra to not wearing a sports bra, here are few things that can spoil the shape of your breasts. 1. Wearing wrong size bra     A study reveals that around 75% of women wear the wrong size of bra. While some women don't actually know how to pick a perfect size for them, some women wear a smaller size to make their boobs look bigger. When you do so, you are constricting your blood vessels and your breast doesn't get the support it needs.  2. Tweezing hair off your breasts    Breasts are the softest body parts and they are highly sensitive. If you use tweezers to get rid of hair from that part, you are harming yourself beyond imagination. You should rather use some gentle methods to remove hair from your breasts. 3. Breast piercing    Many women go for breast piercing in order to make their boobs look sexy. But breast piercing is not advisable because the lymph nodes lie very close to your nipples. Moreover, forget about lacy lingerie after getting your nipples pierced. 4. Working out without a sports bra    Many women don't wear the sports bra while working out. But health and fitness experts say that working out without wearing a sports bra can lead to the deformation of your breasts. It can even lead to pain as your breasts need support while jogging or doing other exercises. 5. Sleeping on your stomach    Yes, you may find this sleeping position quite comfortable but it can lead to changes in the shape of your breasts. But if you can't help but sleep in this position then you must put a pillow under yourself while sleeping. 6. Not moisturizing them    The area around your breasts is very soft and sensitive. If you don't take proper care of them by applying moisturizer or sunscreen, you are harming yourself. 7. Going for surgery to get a perfect shape    Every woman has a different shape of their breast. Comparing yourself to others and then opting for surgery is surely not an option. Breast augmentation can sometimes cause adverse results and can ruin the shape of your breasts forever.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/ever+wondered+why+lord+krishna+never+married+radha-newsid-73193012| History & Religion Ever Wondered Why Lord Krishna Never Married Radha? |  Here's the real reason why!   This question has been on my mind ever since my childhood. Most of us have watched the famous daily soap that starred a cute kid in Lord Krishna's avatar. The show completely justified the happenings that took place in Kanha's life, but unlike me have you also wondered about the fact that why did he end up marrying Rukmini instead of Radha?  The unconditional love that both of them had for each other is something that we are never going to find in any generation. But why is that they never lived together or had a family? Lord Krishna is believed to have approximately 16,000 wives, why isn't Radha one of them?  There are a lot of scriptures that claim the answer to these questions and different versions have different answers for the readers. We have got it all compiled for you here. But, before we get the answers to all our questions, let's have some background check about the subject of the story.  Well, to all the newbies, I mean the next gen kids, he is a Hindu God of compassion, tenderness, and love and is also believed to be the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu.   Radha aka Radharani is believed to be the lover and the most represented companion of Lord Krishna. But, even after getting a lot of mention she never ended up with Krishna.   Read further to know why?   When Krishna was a little boy, he would go by the lake, in Gokul, and start playing the flute for the grazing cows. He continued to do this every day. However, one Gopi, Radha, had captivated him. The whole universe yearned for Krishna, but he yearned for Radha.  That happens with everyone but what's so unusual about it?   According to an article, the unusual thing about this love tale was that Radha was married to Abhimanyu (not the one from Mahabharata) and this is not enough, there were more reasons why the couple never stayed like normal couples.   Read further to know all the possible reasons.   As per Speaking Tree, the reason why this couple did not marry each other is because they had to define the fine line that exists between marrying someone and loving someone. The eternal love that they had for each other could never suffice by giving a tag to their love tale.   According to Speaking Tree, after being so close to Krishna, Radha finally realised that he was not a common man. She was in love with him the way a devotee loves God but it was misunderstood as physical love. Therefore the question of marriage completely disappeared from the picture.  Read further to know other versions of this story.   She is believed to be his energy which pleases and possesses unconditional love to him. Since there is the only element, they did not marry each other.   According to some versions of the story, it is noted that Radha refused to marry Lord Krishna because she felt that she wouldn't be able to adjust in his household because of the fact that she was a cowgirl and people expected Kanha to marry a Princess.  An incident stated that once when Radha asked Krishna, why he wouldn't marry her. He simply said, "How can one marry his or her own soul?"  Their conversation proved that they are a single entity and are not different from each other in spirit and existence.  Radha and Krishna's love can never be compared to earthly definitions and explanations. It is unparalleled and a startling example of the human race to proclaim the supreme union between the human and divine energy around us that is God.  That's all, people.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

The simple reason is he doesn't take up an overseas spot and has got experience playing in the IPL. Also, Parthiv had decent last two seasons with the bat playing for Mumbai Indians.   Brendon McCullum     There is no doubt about how destructive this man can be. Baz is a batsman with no fear and is a fantastic fielder. The only concern is we don't know what type of form he could be in this season. But still, he will be my opener for a few matches.  Virat Kohli (C)     Without a doubt, Kochli is the backbone of RCB's batting. He will be my Orange Cap holder this season.  AB De Villiers     Another big match player for RCB and undoubtedly one of the exciting player to watch. AB is also a superb fielder and RCB will be hoping for big things from him.  Mandeep Singh     I will pick Mandeep ahead of Manan Vohra because he has an experience of playing in the middle overs. He is a decent player of spinners and an excellent fielder.  Sarfaraz Khan     Regarded as an exciting young talent, Sarfaraz is a batsman who has no fear. He is a hard-hitting batsman who can be used as a finisher.  Washington Sundar     Man of the series in the recent T20 series against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Washington is a smart T20 bowler and bowls typically in the powerplay. He is a bowler who bowls at a tight line and is very difficult to get away with. Although, we have not seen him much with the bat.  Chris Woakes     Woakes is an all-rounder who is a handy cricketer. He can be helpful with the ball in both middle and death overs. Also, Woakes is a decent lower-order batsman who can score quick runs.  Tim Southee      An excellent new-ball bowler, who can swing the ball, Southee is a top addition.  Yuzvendra Chahal     A leg-spinner who has been very useful in the T20 format, Chahal He knows how to bowl at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.  Umesh Yadav     Umesh has got plenty of experience in this format. He will be hoping to have a good IPL so that he can get back in the Indian team. Quinton de Kock could be brought in as an opener if McCullum fails to deliver.    The curtains will soon go up for IPL 2018, and all franchises have readied their squads to compete for the title. Royal Challengers Bangalore have been one of the most influential teams in the past 10 seasons. But a title has alluded them, despite being finalists thrice. They have tried to reshape the squad and worked to increase the depth, making them strong contenders yet again! Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 03 Apr, 3.22 pm

Kalyani came to the police station along with her counsel and in the complaint, said she performs 'Harikatha' programmes on Lord Shiva and other gods. Recently, she came across a programme on YouTube posted by Shiva Shakthi Sai TV. "I was put to shock and agony watching it. I opened the link and watched the programme wherein the channel has run the programme with objectionable comments on my womanhood, character, personal life and my work. In the second part, they showed my personal life in most objectionable manner," she said adding that she never gave interview to the channel but they had collected visuals from various sources, edited and used those.  She further said Ramanananda earlier made objectionable comments on Ramayanam, Lord Rama and Lord Hanuman. Offended by those, she objected during a debate. Bearing a grudge since then, he was using his channel to harass her. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 01 Feb, 5.16 pm2 days ago3 months ago2 months ago2 months ago4 days ago

Ashi Khanna Has Set Some Serious Modelling Standards | Today, we are interviewing an upcoming modelling sensation, Ashi Khanna, a girl who's been a popular muser on the well known musical.ly site, a model for various brands, and most importantly a generous soul. Ashi is a social media influencer and has worked with brands like L'oreal, Daniel Wellington etc. Ashi has also done a shoot with Images Bazaar and has been face of Airtel's ad recently. Ashi Khanna, in an exclusive interview with Student Stories 1. Firstly, who or what was reason that made you decide to step into this field?  I really wanted to live a life of a celebrity. Whenever I used to scroll down my feed, I always thought, "I wish I were her" or "I wish even I had that opportunity", but merely thinking won't get you anywhere, you need to work for it. I got my first shoot after I started building my Instagram profile, which was for a designer boutique in Shahpur Jaat. It is basically a hub of luxury Indian wear outfits. So that was basically my first step into this field, back in 2016. 2. Who was your role model while you were busy aiming high? I used to observe people very carefully, tried adapting the qualities they had in them. There wasn't any particular person whom I looked up to, I made sure that I wasn't a copy of anybody. I have always wanted to create my own identity and make sure that it is unique and has an edge to it. 3. What difficulties have you faced to reach such great heights? While you are aiming to be successful, you need to know that you're going to face an incredible amount of criticism. Maintaining the confidence, zeal and determination while you are paving your way through is the most difficult part. People will always try to bring you down but one needs to stay undeterred. So according to me, learning to stay positive and avoiding everybody's pessimistic opinions has really been a tough task for me. Also read "Art Has Always Been My Solace , Fortress And Empowerment", Says Penguin India's Youngest Author ! Megha Rao With A Dash Of love And Art"  4. What do you think is preferable acting or modeling? Both the professions have their own pros and cons. So this is a very subjective question. But according to me, if you ask, acting is the trump card. The reason being that it has more to explore. You play different roles and learn being versatile. You can be more creative. This is my personal opinion, as I already said that it is a very subjective question. 5. Being a part of a sponsored ad with Airtel seems to be a good catch. How do you rate this milestone in your journey? I have been doing small projects but yes obviously this Airtel ad being a greater clutch, means a lot to me. I believe that this is just the start and there is much more to come, I am eagerly waiting to experience what life further has in store for me. 6. Being successful at such a tender age is not everyone's cup of tea, how has your career shaped in the past year? Nothing worth having comes easy. If you have an aim, if you have faith in yourself, you can achieve it. It doesn't matter how small or big it is, if you think you can, YOU CAN! Always remember, thoughts become things- that is what I have been following. This has been my mantra. The life that I am living now,the things I have now are something that I once wished for. I haven't really opted modeling or acting as my career as of now, I am still a student and I have to manage my studies as well. I do this as a hobby and I love it. Last year has been full of ups and downs for me but I think 2017 has been pretty lucky! 7. What can you, as Ashi Khanna, a role model, would like to convey to the readers regarding how they can achieve heights that you've achieved? I haven't achieved anything that great yet, but I am surely working on it. My message to the readers will be just that stay focused and don't try to please everybody around you. Because if you do, you will never be able to move ahead in life. It is great if you have people around you who support you. But if not, don't worry; be a one man army. You are good enough, and you are the best in whatever you do, so continue doing it irrespective of what others think of you. Just don't give up, keep working for that goal! You are going to make yourself proud, one day. 8. Please name a few people who've always stood behind you through your thick and thin. How have they contributed towards your success? My family, hands down! Rest of the people have only played a temporary role in my life but still I am grateful to them as they have always taught me something or the other. Some of my friends have been a lesson and some a blessing. Above all, my family has always supported me in whatever I have done and they continue to do so. They have never restricted my path , they've given me the freedom that I required to reach here and where I am aiming right now. There is so much more to achieve.

The center is already consulting with the concerned stakeholders before the announcement. Firstly, the Center proposed a Special Railway Zone with Guntakal as the headquarters but then Andhra Pradesh government has declined the proposal as such will only create regional differences in the state. Now, the center is proposing an alternate model to pacify Odisha. The parts of Odisha which are currently in Vishakapatnam division may be retained by East Coast Railway Zone. The new zone for Andhra Pradesh will have the existing AP parts of Vishakapatnam Division and Guntur, Guntakal, Vijayawada divisions which are under South Central Railway Zone. This may give rise to objections from Telangana Government as the South Central Railway Zone will be losing profitable zones. There are a couple of other proposals as well under the consideration of the Central government. We can only hope the announcement will not create more problems.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/sportzwiki+english-epaper-sptwiken/wwe+twitter+reactions+from+this+week+s+episode+of+raw+april+9+2018-newsid-85416912| Home WWE: Twitter Reactions from this Week's Episode of RAW: April 9, 2018 | The crowd was ready to take over last night's episode of WWE Raw from the get-go. Abusive chants started to pick up at the very beginning when Stephanie McMahon showed up to address the crowd. They literally used insulting words which were not appropriate for a PG TV show. From that perspective, it was definitely not something funny and not appreciated. Good debut for Ember Moon. A nice showcase match for her. She looked great with all her stuff. Hopefully they utilize her well on the main roster. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  The series of debuts and returns were inevitable for the post-Wrestlemania episode of WWE Raw. It started with the former WWE NXT Women's Champion, Ember Moon. It was good to see her getting the spotlight during her debut match. She pinned the former women's champion which is quite an accolade and will set her up for future accolades.  A similar showcasing return was seen for Bobby Lashley and the other NXT superstars, as well. We all knew it was coming, but that was a stunning announcement from Paige on her retirement. Paige gave a really nice and emotional speech about her love of the business. Powerful stuff. My heart goes out to her. She's still so young. Nice it all came full circle in NOLA. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  The feud between Sasha Banks and Bayley continues on WWE Raw, but the heart-breaking news of Paige getting retired from the in-ring competition was also announced. It's hard to believe she had to hang up her boots at an early age of just 24. One of the most popular superstars of this generation who can accomplish much more in her career which was cut short. Good comeback for Samoa Joe. Joe would be an excellent rival against Brock Lesnar. The Roman Reigns promo didn't do anything for me. I felt like last night was the night to pull the trigger. Not doing it... yikes. What are they holding off for? Not good. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  The promo delivered by Roman Reigns following the Wrestlemania loss was much cooler, as the fans did not enjoy it much. But, they did enjoy the return of Samoa Joe in the main event capacity. He is going to be huge fit for Roman Reigns' opponent in the near future. This is a mouth-watering rivalry that will get renewed on WWE Raw. Huge pop for Jeff Hardy's return. No sign of Brother Nero. Hardy looks like he'll slide right into the Intercontinental Championship picture. Good segment all around. I particularly liked The Miz and his complaining. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  Furthermore, a standing ovation was reserved for Jeff Hardy on WWE Raw after missing six months of action due to injury. Showing up in his original character instead of Brother Nero was a major surprise for the crowd. He lived up to the expectations by giving high-flying entertainment during the main event match which ended the show on light not. A ton of new debuts, good segments, and good matches highlight a three-hour #RAWAfterMania that just flew by. I really enjoyed myself tonight. #RAW— Wrestleview.com (@wrestleview) April 10, 2018  Check out one of the best episodes of WWE Raw in 2018: Looking forward to this......#RAW #RAWAfterMania pic.twitter.com/WHeCNSIyat— Mark Hainsworth (@bcafcmark) April 10, 2018  ok this segment was actually fantastic. #RAW #RAWaftermania pic.twitter.com/2vVpz2r6Ur— Pro Wrestling Sheet (@WrestlingSheet) April 10, 2018  "And if anyone knows about failure it's a guy who spent a decade in TNA" - @SamoaJoe #RAW— WWE Creative Humor (@WWECreative_ish) April 10, 2018  "If they continue to put me in matches with @BrockLesnar, the story will end with me becoming the #UniversalChampion!" - @WWERomanReignsYou can't take the FIGHT out of #TheBigDog! #RAW #RAWAfterMania pic.twitter.com/CF9j6Devxr— WWE (@WWE) April 10, 2018  Family reunion? #RAW #RAWAfterMania @JEFFHARDYBRAND @MATTHARDYBRAND @WWEBrayWyatt pic.twitter.com/hQ9dRG4303— WWE (@WWE) April 10, 2018  IS THIS REAL LIFE?!?!?

Unfreedom  is a contemporary thriller based in a society torn apart by political, religious and sexual turmoil. Alternating between New York and New Delhi, the film combines two powerful stories about religious fundamentalism and intolerance. One of which follows a Muslim terrorist Husain (Bhanu Uday), attempting to silence a liberal Muslim scholar Fareed (Victor Banerjee). The other story is about a young woman Leela (Preeti Gupta), who defies her devout father Devraj (Adil Hussain) and escapes an arranged marriage because she is secretly involved in a taboo lesbian romance with Sakhi (Bhavani Lee).   Through these stories, the film creates a powerful portrait of the troubled times we live in and depicts the lengths to which the protagonists go in order to hold on to their strong and conflicting viewpoints on freedom, faith, family and love.    Unfreedom  is based on an original story by Raj Amit Kumar and marks his directorial feature film debut. He has also produced the film under the banner of Dark Frames and co-written the screenplay with Damon J Taylor.  The film's technical team comprises of Oscar-winner Resul Pookutty (Slumdog Millionaire) who has done the sound design for the film and was nominated for the Motion Picture Sound Editors' 63rd annual Golden Reel Awards. The film is shot by award winning cinematographer Hari Nair (Shutter,  Kerala Café) and edited by Atanu Mukherjee, who debuted as a director with the acclaimed film,  Rukh (2017).    Unfreedom  was banned by the India's Censor Board of Film Certification, (CBFC) in 2015 (which was then headed by Pahlaj Nihalani) who ere of the opinion that the film will ignite unnatural (read homosexual) passions and incite rapes and communal violence in India. Initially the film was under review by CBFC who wanted director Raj Amit Kumar to cut crucial elements from the film in order to be shown to the Indian public.  Not to be bogged down by their demands, Kumar appealed before Indian Government's Information and Broadcasting Appellate Tribunal, (FCAT). And in response, the FCAT banned the film without any possibility of cutting or further appeals.  Later Kumar and his team ran a campaign for a year during which they did around 100 screenings of the film globally in India and U.S among other countries. The film was screened to immensely encouraging audience response in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Los Angeles and New York. Following this, the film was recently released internationally by Netflix.   Talking about the film's release by Netflix, director Raj Amit Kumar said, "I am glad that Unfreedom finds such a popular platform like Netflix after the ban in India and the efforts of censorship guardians in India to stop the film. It also exposes the hypocrisy and divide between reality and fantasy of censorship system in India. There is no way they can control and censor content in digital age, yet, they try their best to choke filmmakers like me who have something relevant to say that makes them feel threatened."   Elaborating on the film's ban by CBFC and it being labeled as one of the boldest Indian films ever, Kumar said, "The boldness of something is always defined by what you are allowed to say or not in a society. The boldness of an artist is always defined by what others artist around him have not said or what they are not allowed to express. Thus, it is not the content in my film per say makes it bold, but it the context of a society in which it is told, it is the fact that we have become such a weak and conservative society where we are asked to shut up all the time. Our voices are being crushed unless we are chanting slogans that the powers to be and moral guardians are ok with.    And in today's time our art is being crushed in much more violent ways than ever before. Journalists are getting killed, films are getting banned for slightest of transgressions and the whole mediascape is turned into a trumpet sound. Any other vision, voice, expression has to be curtailed. So I guess it is the boldest film ever because I did not give a damn about anyone or anybody. I didn't care and I don't think I will care in future as well. Unless artists take that approach and risk their well being, we will soon be living in a world where everybody is frightened to say anything truthful."   About The Director:  Raj Amit Kumar graduated in Masters of Arts in Cinema and Media Studies from City University of New York (CUNY) in 2006, where he received the George Custen Memorial Award for Academic Excellence. Kumar finished his Ph.D. coursework in Cinema and Media studies at Southern Illinois University (SIUC) before beginning work on his first feature film, originally titled Blemished Light, the script of which won the First Prize in Faculty Screenwriting Award at University of film and Video Association (UFVA) 2009. Also a media academic, teacher, and writer, Kumar has taught cinema theory and history at both his alma maters, City University of New York and Southern Illinois University College (2005 - 2009) and his writings and research papers have been published and presented at various conferences. In early 2012, Kumar established Dark Frames as a development and production company. Its primary goal is to develop and produce provocative independent films.   Unfreedom  is produced by Dark Frames.

Vu has been visible on the TV segment for quite a few years in India, Xiaomi debuted its Mi TV 4 in the country recently. Both the brands are offering premium products under budget, and it is bound to confuse the potential smart TV buyers in India. Vu CEO recently calls Xiaomi low-end brand; Claims Sony, Sharp are real competitors. The soring competition and confusion has implored us to compare Vu's Android 4K UHD LED TV (55-inch) with the Xiaomi's 4K HDR Mi TV 4 (55-inch). Below we will be comparing both the products by screen size, operating system, Refresh rate, contrast ratio, RAM, Storage, connectivity, app support, and price in India.  Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Display Regarding screen size, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV comes in three different variants - 43-inch, 49-inch, and 55-inch. However, the Xiaomi Mi TV 4 4K HDR comes in a single variant featuring 55-inch screen size. Both the TVs from Xiaomi and Vu come with 60Hz of refresh rate and 6000:1 contrast ratio. Even the pixel resolution on both the TVs is same, i.e., 3840×2160 pixels resolution. But Xiaomi's Mi TV 4 takes the cake regarding design, it boasts a bezel-less display with thinnest frame size. Vu's 4K UHD LED TV, on the other hand, comes with bezels that looks less attractive in front of the Mi TV 4. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Hardware and Connectivity Options The Xiaomi Mi TV 4 packs 2GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. Xiaomi claims that the internal storage on the TV will be utilized for software updates that the device will be receiving quite often. On the other hand, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV offers 2.5GB RAM and 16GB internal storage. The storage on the TV will be used for gaming and app operations, rather than incremental software updates. Regarding connectivity, the Mi TV 4 bears dual-band Wi-Fi (802.11ac), three HDMI ports, two USB ports, an Ethernet port, and Bluetooth v4.0. While the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV also settles with dual-band Wi-Fi, three HDMI ports, two USB ports, an Ethernet port. Under this comparison, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV takes the cakes with its higher RAM and storage capacities. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Software and Apps Coming to the software side of things, the Mi TV 4 runs Xiaomi's in-house PatchWall UI layer on top of Android. The company has customized the OS for Indian consumers, making it compatible with their requirements and viewing habits. The company has collaborated with Indian content providers like Hotstar, Voot, Sony Liv, and Hungama Play, and more. These services are touted to offer over 500,000 hours of content. Moreover, the Mi TV 4 can also be integrated with the set-top-box from providers like Dish TV, Tata Sky, Hathway and Siti cable. The Mi TV 4 also includes Mi remote with 11 buttons. But it works with Mi Cable that is priced at Rs. 299. On the contrary, the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV runs Android 7.0 Nougat and is expected to get updated to Android 8.0 Oreo by the second half of 2018. Vu has partnered with YouTube, Netflix, Hotstar, Alt Balaji, Sony Liv, Google Movies-TV, and others to offer content streaming. The remote control for the TV includes voice control and a dedicated button for Netflix. One of the most interesting and worthy additions on the Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV comprises Chromecast integration. It means that the TV comes pre-equipped with Chromecast support and the users don't need to buy the dongle separately. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Price in India Xiaomi's 55-inch Mi TV 4 is priced at Rs. 39,999, making it the most affordable 4K smart TV on the market right now. The Vu Android 4K UHD LED TV comes with a price tag of Rs. Rs. 50,990 bringing it close in competition with the Mi TV 4. Mi TV 4 55 inch 4k HDR vs Vu TV 55 inch 4k UHD: Verdict After comparing all the specs and features, we have come to a conclusion that the Xiaomi Mi TV 4 is a very strong competitor for Vu in Android 4K LED TV Segment. Though Vu is better equipped, if you are looking for an under 40k smart TV with bezel-less design, then the Mi TV 4 should be your ultimate buy. Zara writes for more blogs than we can keep count of. Her nocturnal trait ensures that she doesn't come to the office often. If she is not writing about the latest tech news, she is generally binging on TV shows. sound output port the Price for VU 55' Tv is 56000 and MI tv is value for Money in 40K. looking at the technology used, Design and the Price MI 4k TV Stands out with 40000 Price. you add firestick or chromecast for 2-3K to get access to netflix and amazon. 16000 is a huge difference, you can buy a good soundbar for 16000.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/15+of+the+most+controversial+photos+ever-newsid-74480467| Photography 15 Of The Most Controversial Photos Ever |  Featuring black power salute and many more.  We all love looking at photographs, don't we? They are like a portal to the past which lets us look at the exact moment it was taken. Once a photograph is taken, there's no changing it. There's always the old cliche' stating a picture is worth a thousand words and we don't need to explain why.  But some pictures can spark debate too. It could be either the object, the subject or some other factor which can spark debate or some or the other form of outrage. So today we at WittyFeed would like to look back at 15 such photos which sparked controversy.  When six years old, Elián González was the subject of an intense custodial battle between the United States and Cuba. His father who was a Cuban won the appeal and this photo is captured the exact moment when he was taken away.  This photo is from Vietnam where the National Committee was protesting against the military, calling for an end of the war. One particular protestor was inserting flowers into barrels as a peace symbol.  This photo shows the plight of a prisoner who is being subjected to abuse in the Abu Gharib prison in Iraq. There were far worse atrocities committed inside the prison than the one photographed here.  Although there are some doubts about the authenticity of this photo, this photo was taken in the Spanish civil war, moments, after the soldier portrayed above, was shot.  This self-portrait of the photographer Cindy Sherman was sold for 3.5 million dollars in 2011. Cindy was known for conceptual portraits but this photo showcases her in somewhat vulnerable position and hence it fetched such a price.  This photo depicts a Soviet soldier hoisting the flag over Berlin during the final stages of World War II. Eventually, the truth was spilled that the photograph was staged.  This controversial photograph depicts Sophia Lauren catching a peek at Jayne Mansfield's cleavage. It was said that Jayne used to wear extra revealing clothes to attract media.  At the 1968 Olympics, sprinters, John Carlos and Peter Norman held up a black power salute on the podium.  In China's 1989 democracy movement, one man channeled all his courage and valor to stand in front of a platoon of tanks arriving in order to break protests. This is one of the most courageous acts in history.  Dear cat lovers, please look away! The photo depicts wet cats airborne but we must tell you that they weren't airborne by choice. They were thrown and water was splashed on them. This photograph took numerous attempts to execute.   An explosion of historical proportions as the world never saw the mass devastation of such kind. This photograph was captured moments after the bomb was dropped.  Rosa Parks was arrested once because she refused to give her seat away. This very photograph was taken a year after her arrest where she's seen sitting at the same iconic spot on the bus which landed her in trouble.  This surreal photo was taken by an American photographer who caught a Vietnamese fighter being executed on the streets by a police member.  This photo was snapped by a photographer showcasing the sad state of polar bears thanks to climate change. This bear is thinner than usual and looks quite weak. The main controversy, however, was whether the polar bear was in such a state because of melting ice caps or age?  You thought happy selfies have no place on this list? Think again. Although it's an amazing picture, it sparked a controversial debate as to who is the rightful owner of the photo, the cameraman who allowed the monkey to play with his camera or the monkey himself?

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+indian+economist-epaper-indecono/britannia+s+direct+supply+model+continues+to+evolve+as+it+aims+to+reach+the+rural+market-newsid-83259629| Recent Articles Britannia's direct supply model continues to evolve as it aims to reach the rural market |  By Surya Ramesh   Traditionally, FMCG companies have employed a vast network of wholesalers and distributors in order to service retail outlets across the country. However, since 2014, Britannia and a few other companies have tried to go against the tide by adopting a direct distribution model. This move was the brainchild of Varun Berry, the company's managing director.  Understanding Britannia's direct distribution model  The direct distribution model, adopted in 2014, has Britannia at the helm of operations. Personnel from Britannia visit retail stores, analyse demand patterns and make forecasts about demand. The removal of the wholesaler from the supply chain enables the company to streamline the supply chain and reduce the order completion time. The success of this model hinges on the accurate positioning of distributors to match the requirements of retailers and reduce transportation costs. Britannia's CEO, Varun Berry, decided to adopt this model in order to boost the company's reach in rural India. The company hopes to achieve a 50-50 revenue split between rural and urban India in the near future. Gunjan Shah, VP of Sales at Britannia Industries believes that this move has worked wonders and he said, "Direct distribution results in much better offtake of brands. We have seen two to three times higher brand offtake (sales) after we started serving a particular retail outlet directly." Evolutions in the model Over the past three years, Britannia has continuously worked on improving its distribution model. The latest iteration focuses on cutting down distribution time from three weeks to one day and adopting a zero-day inventory model. Currently, there are close to 31 lakh retailers of Britannia who use the wholesaler mode of distribution. Company executives are confident about bringing 2-3 lakh retailers onto the direct network every year. The direct model will enable Britannia to have greater control over the supply chain and also ensure easy availability of data for analysis. In today's day and age, the prevalence of data analytics has made data a valuable commodity with a direct play on the company's financial statements. The new model aims to cut operational costs for all stakeholders by reducing the amount of safety stock required. A Mckinsey report suggests that the direct distribution model could also reduce working capital costs by 10 percent and distribution costs by 20 percent. What does the future hold? Parle has the largest retail reach in the biscuit segment, and the direct distribution model is Britannia's attempt at wresting back the market share. ITC has also experimented with the direct distribution model in 2015, and the company is currently working on reducing the distribution time. The method will undoubtedly ensure a larger market share and higher revenues for the company. However, it is important to remember that the commercial viability of a model is the most crucial factor. Sales must translate into better margins in the future for this model to be universally adopted. There are questions regarding the effectiveness of the direct distribution model in remote areas and the minimum retailer revenue for the model to be viable. Hence, this latest innovation in the supply chain is certainly something to watch out for in the near future.

As far as we know you are from a very small town Ujire, how did you train yourself so well to bring yourself to this position today? Did you get the necessary opportunities? Growing up in a small village 20 years ago with no access to internet or TV I had no other way to get inspired but by the beautiful nature around. I am a self taught artist. Opportunities didn't come my way - I had to struggle to create my own path. 2. Was there any specific person or reason which made you interested in this field of art? Nature is my biggest source of inspiration to paint. I feel it has everything that an aspiring artist looks for. With regards to speed painting I was inspired by BKS Verma and Denny Dent.   Also Read "  3. Tell us about the journey of a small town guy to the 'Asia's fastest speed painter'? I was always into art from age 3. All that I dreamed of becoming in future was an artist. Because I was good in academics everyone encouraged me to carry on with that and join work. I had to follow that path to make a living also. However after working for about 6 years as a Human Resource officer in MNCs I realized I am not making use of my talent. That growing dissatisfaction pushed me to get more involved in paintings and I took part in a regional reality show in Karnataka before getting into India's Got Talent in 2011. That was my first big break. I quit my job after the reality show and then went on to perform in 25 countries. Asia's Got Talent was a great exposure on International media. 4. We all have seen you in 'India's Got Talent', how did you feel showcasing your talent on National Television? Tell us about your complete experience in IGT? Showcasing talent on national TV was an exhilarating experience. I was nervous all the time and it was very stressful in that way. Just the pressure of exceeding your performance each time was a learning experience. It was fantastic to meet Bollywood stars like SRK, Salman Khan, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Kiron Kher and many more. The show gave me confidence to perform at any big stage.  5. What was the major turning point in your life or career according to you? Definetly, appearing on national television show - India's Got Talent and taking risk to quit my job soon after that. 6. What are the challenges that you had to face to establish yourself and what are the challenges that you face daily? The challenge was and still is to 'Be yourself'. We need to remain that unique person and not become a copy of someone else. Because I believed in my instinct and went on to pursue my passion for Speed painting I could create new avenues to perform. It's an ongoing challenge that every artist faces. 7. Do you feel that a reality show can influence the career of an artist to a great level? Definitely yes! My life so far is an example itself that it influences an artist career positively. But yes we need to understand that reality shows kick starts an artist's career for sure but then after an year when the public memory fades, it's up to the artist to continue- to be innovative and passionate to go a long distance. Else like most of the reality shows sensations we will disappear in no time.  8. What has been the most memorable moment in your complete journey? There have been many but getting a hug and blessing from The Dalai Lama on stage and meeting personalities like Pele and Abdul Kalam was memorable. 9. Do you think you have already achieved your ultimate goal or is there more you've got to achieve? I am happy about the progress so far, but there's much more I want to do in future. 10. Tell us about the support of your family and friends throughout and how do they feel when they see you presenting live shows all over the world? Family and friends have always supported me.

As per the baseline ranking, Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh is ranked highest with score of 48.13 per cent while Mewat in Haryana tails at the end with 26.02 per cent. Among others, Asifabad (Telangana), Singrauli (Madhya Pradesh), Kiphire (Nagaland), Shrawasti, Siddarthnagar and Balrampur (Uttar Pradesh), Namsai (Arunachal Pradesh), Sukma (Chattisgarh) are ranked at bottom of the list.  While on top of the list among others include Rajnandgaon (Chhattisgarh), Osmanabad (Maharashtra), Cuddapah (Andhra Pradesh), Ramanathapuram (Tamil Nadu), Udham Singh Nagar (Uttarakhand), Mahasamund (Chhattisgarh), Khammam (Telangana), Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). From April 1, these 101 districts will start entering data and the real-time data collection and monitoring will be open for public viewing. From May onwards, they will be ranked based on progress made (delta ranking) on a real-time basis. NITI Aayog and the Andhra Pradesh government have created a dashboard for monitoring the real-time progress of the districts. The 49 indicators on 81 data points will cover five development areas - health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development and basic infrastructure. While announcing the launch of ranking for the "Aspirational Districts', NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said: "India cannot grow at a high rate on a long run until these districts catch up, whatever high are the GDP number, it has no meaning until the benefit of growth percolates down to very basic level." The ranking of districts comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 'Transformation of Aspirational Districts' in January with an aim to quickly and effectively transform some of the most underdeveloped districts in the country. This will converge the central and state schemes, collaborate central, state and district collectors to strengthen these districts by identifying the low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement, measure progress and then rank the district by getting the data on a real-time basis. All the states - except West Bengal and Kerala - are on board in this ranking initiative; however, these states are expected to join soon, Kant said. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 29 Mar, 11.31 am4 days ago

Also, there are many other celebs who are facing the heat from Tollywood and Kollywood industry.

Sri Reddy recently staged a drama outside the Movie Artistes Association (MAA)'s office in Hyderabad in order to protest against the problem. When no one paid a heed, she stripped off her clothes in public.  In an interview, she said that she has done this because producers are bringing actresses from other states and ignoring the local talent.   Here is what Sri Reddy said to Hindustan Times, "The reason is simple. Heroines from other states would go to any extent to satisfy the big people in Tollywood, whereas the local artists are not so bold." "The reason is simple.

I have had to strip myself nude in front of several people in the film industry who promised work. Yet, I got no roles.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

The next two months will see telcos trying to win over each other in the battle of grabbing the attention of around 700 million sports fans in India who are expected to stay glued to the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018. The main objective of companies will be to fetch heavy data users during the season as they watch the livestreaming of these matches on their smartphones. This way, the companies will be able to push average revenue per user (ARPU) in two months. While BSNL's special IPL recharge pack that offers 3GB data per day is limited to 3G speeds, Airtel took a different route by partnering with Hotstar to provide its subscribers with live streaming of matches and highlights on the Airtel TV app. Interestingly, Airtel has also started offering MIMO Pre-5G services at IPL 2018 venues for its users. The first venue to get the service is Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The battle is not just limited to sports, in the past few months we have witnessed telcos in India trying out different means to push users towards greater data consumption. For example, Airtel has started offering free Amazon Prime subscription to the users who recharge for more than a specific amount.

Budhwar Peth, Pune    The third largest red in India with around 5000 commercial sex workers, Budhwar Peth in Pune is also a spot where individuals go shopping for gadgets, books, and impeccable knick-knacks. India's richest Ganesh Temple, Dagadusheth Halwai Ganapati Temple is also situated in this place. 5.

Meergunj, Allahabad    Famous for illegal trafficking and forced prostitution, this red light district is the most notorious area in the city. There are four paths in the city which really go under the red light zone. It is a spot where minor country young ladies are purchased and sold. 7. Chaturbhujsthan, Muzaffarpur    It is one of the most seasoned red light regions of Bihar situated in the fourth most populated city in the state.

He only saw Padmini in a reflection as she didn't allow him to see her face to face."     Image Source  Alauddin captured Raja Ratan Singh. "Alauddin deceitfully captured Ratan Singh. This led to the women of Chittor prepare for Jauhar while the fight was still going on. As many soldiers of Chittor's army died, Ratan Singh also died while fighting beside his men."     Image Source      Image Source  Rani Padmini was the first who jumped in the Jauhar Kund. "The women walked down a secret passage within the fort that led to the Jauhar Kund. Padmini was the first to jump in the Jauhar Kund while other women followed."     Image Source      Image Source  "Their cries and wailings were so loud that Alauddin ordered the passage to be closed permanently and it was reopened only after many years by the king of Chittor to honour the brave women."

After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

The biggest show in the WWE industry has always caught the imagination of the wrestling fanatics, and the just-concluded 34th edition also lived up to its billing. Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey making her in-ring debut was probably the show-stopper. She teamed up Kurt Angle to defeat Stephanie McMahon and Triple H in a thrilling bout. At the same time, some can say the main attraction of the night was the much-anticipated fight between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar defeated a bloodied Reigns to retain his Universal Championship Match. The event also saw the return of The Undertaker, as he made a winning comeback by thrashing John Cena.  In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history. It is safe to say that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the event.  A bloodied Reigns lost to Lesnar But amidst all this, something unfortunate happened. WWE star Natalya suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction during the event. After being thrown out of the rind during women's Battle Royal, she fell on the floor in an uncompromising position. The cameras were quick to point out the part which was visible, much to the embarrassment of Natalya.

The girl, who was seen in the 1.7-minute-long video, is believed to be a resident of Bhadrak district. It appears that the male partner has shot their intimate moments, in the know of the girl. So far, no complaint has been registered with police in this regard. The incident will surely give fresh headache to the cops as the police are still investigating similar cases including the sensational case involving a youth and a girl from Chandbali in Bhadrak district. The youth had allegedly uploaded hundreds of sex videos to various pornographic websites.  Few days later, the youth was found dead on the banks of Kuakhai river here. Concerned over the situation, Odisha police had earlier issued advisory to all the district SPs and public to check circulation of such videos on the internet. "An advisory has been given to all the district SPs and police officers to follow a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with cases right from examining the objectionable images and videos that are going viral on social media platforms till filing the cases," DGP RP Sharma had told after inaugurating a cyber forensic division on the premises of the State Forensic Laboratory here in November last year.

Arpita Khan Sharma, who considered as the most loved sister of 'Khandaan.' We have always seen Salman Khan and his family shower love and care on this 28-year-old daughter of their family. The entire fans of Bollywood admire the Khandaan for being such a sweet family. Arpita Khan Sharma who turned 28 on August 1, despite never being a part of Hindi Films, has always been a popular name among the fans of Bollywood. She has always been the talk of the town, for all the good reasons of course. Arpita who is the youngest sister of Salman, Arbaaz and Sohail Khan, is very close to her brother and especially an apple of Salman's eye. When the news of Arpita wedding with her longtime boyfriend Ayush Sharma surfaced, it made it to the headlines of all the leading newspapers, mags and channels.  Needless to say, that when it came to his adorable sister Arpita's wedding, Salman and the entire 'Khandaan' didn't leave a stone unturned to make it a fairytale one. So, on this auspicious occasion of Rakhi, we are here to tell you something about the most fortunate sister of tinsel town. Here are some lesser-known facts about Arpita Khan Sharma's life, we bet you didn't know.  Arpita was born on August 1, 1989. Despite not being a biological daughter of Salim Khan, she has always been the most loved member of their family.   It is said that Arpita was adopted by Salman's parents Salim and Salma Khan. There are different stories around in the media, around her adoption.   While some say that Arpita's mother was a beggar and lived on a footpath. She died right after giving birth to Arpita. And Salim and Salma spotted this infant near her dead body on the footpath they were passing by. Hence, they brought her home along and decided to make her a part of their family forever.   The reports in the media also state that Salim's second wife Helen was the one who adopted Arpita. This is how Arpita became an Angel from an orphan.  Very few people know that Arpita has really got a great fashion sense. She is a fashion graduate from London College Of Fashion and holds a degree in fashion marketing and management.   Before Arpita got married to Ayush Sharma, she used to work for an architectural and interior designing firm. This Beti of 'Khandaan' dreams of owning her own fashion brand one day.  In the year 2014, Arpita got a tattoo of a star, which contains the names of all her family members. The tattoo has got Salim Khan, mothers Salma and Helen, brothers Salman, Arbaaz. Sohail, sister Alvira and friend Deeksha.   This isn't much known that when Arpita dated Arjun Kapoor for two years. When Arpita and Arjun were in a relationship Arjun weighed 140 Kgs. But fate had some other plans for this couple. Arjun and Arpita broke up and the reason for their split is still not known. Seems like their break up didn't affect Arjun's terms with Khandaan and especially Salman Khan, Coz he is still close to that family.  Once again, cupid struck Arpita when she met Delhi based businessman, Ayush Sharma. Ayush hails from Delhi and belongs to a royal family. Unlike Arpita, Ayush has got plans to make Bollywood debut soon.  Arpita's wedding with Ayush Sharma is considered as the most expensive wedding of B-town. If the reports are to be believed, Arpita always wanted to get married in a palace. Ergo, Salman who can make all possible efforts to make his sister's wish come true booked the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad for her wedding. Her fairytale wedding was a Star studded affair.  Arpita is now happily married to Ayush and gave birth to a baby, Ahil, in March 2016. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 14 Aug, 6.41 am

Why PM Jawaharlal Nehru refused ? | Only three countries in the world, in 2010 had a majority Hindu population - India, Nepal & Mauritius. Nepal had offered to join the Indian Union after India's independence in 1947. Ex RSS Chief KS Sudarshan had said that it was Independent India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who rejected the offer. "Shortly after independence, the then Nepal Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala had conveyed his country's wish to join India to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru," Mr Sudarshan had said in 2008, while addressing a function. However, Pandit Nehru rejected the offer fearing international criticism that India had turned expansionist immediately after freedom, the Ex RSS Chief had said. India & Nepal signed a bilateral treaty in 1950 establishing a close strategic relationship between the two South Asian neighbours. It is famously called - 'The 1950 India-Nepal Treaty of Peace & Friendship.' The treaty basically offered economic opportunities in India for Nepalese nationals against Nepalese assurances that India's security concerns would be respected. The treaty was signed by the Indian ambassador Chandeshwar Narayan Singh (disrespect for protocol) with Nepal PM Mohan Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana. Rana was left to ponder with a lot, during the last days of his discredited regime.  The treaty which is more than 6 decades old was under threat in the year 2008 when a collation government was formed in Nepal. The leader of the Communist party of Nepal (Maoist) Pushpa Kamal Dahal had said that the 1950 treaty with India would be scrapped and a new pact would be negotiated with India. However, he was not able to pursue the matter & had to resign within 9 months of his tenure. Nehru was also responsible for giving away Tibet to China, without even raising an alarm against China's expansionist policy. Nehru did not speak up even when China tried to stake its claim on Sikkim & Arunachal Pradesh. He wanted the support of the communists & hence decided to keep mum. Jawaharlal Nehru believed in the foreign policy of 'idealism.' Nehru just wanted to please his western counterparts at the UN; some of them may have not bothered to even find Nepal on the world map. In 1951, King Tribhuwan of Nepal fled to India, not because he wanted to but was not left with any option. The democracy in Nepal was under threat & the Rana rule was ready to overpower the king. The king had opposed the Ranas& hence the only option was to support India. Nehru could have used the opportunity to consolidate the Hindu majority, but this was to be the beginning of Nehru's distasteful legacy. India is a country which has never invaded any other country. We do not believe in the expansionist policies practised by countries like China. There are 10 articles in the 1950 treaty & if the need arises the treaty should be negotiated.Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 26 Dec, 9.59 am

However, all were lucky and 7 employees were suspended by the railway following this train accident. The train coaches kept going unattached until stones were placed across the tracks to stop the train. The train travelled for 13 kms without being controlled by the engine the other way until it was stopped by the placement of stones.      image source   How it all happened?  Here's how it all happened. The Ahmedabad Puri express had to reverse its direction to travel to Puri. This reverse direction or reverse travelling is called rake reversal or loku. In this process, the engine of the train is disconnected and reconnected to the other side of the train. The coaches are fastened together using the help of skip brakes on the wheels of the train. As per the EcoR spokesperson, it is probably because the skid brakes were not applied properly resulting in the train moving back towards the region of Kesinga and the train went backwards which lead it to go off route. The district of Kalahandi is situated at a downward slope of Titlagarh.     image source   All express train passengers are safe  Passengers were not hurt in the incident but they all recall the horror that they went through after they realized the train was moving without the engine attached. Chief Minister took to Twitter to express concern and said the railway minister must take steps to address the lapses. Social media is full of video clips which are circulating and showing people at the station screaming out to passengers inside the train to pull the chain in order to stop the train.     image source  The passengers were not aware of anything wrong until they realized that the train was traveling without the engine attached. Many passengers recalled the feeling of horror at the incident. The train was finally stopped when stones were placed on the tracks as per sources. One of the passengers said, "Before we could understand anything, it had started rolling towards Kesinga. We tried pulling the chains but nothing happened since there was no engine." The passenger added, "I think it was going at 40kmph. When it crossed the river bridge, we were trembling with fear." Dailyhunt	|Monday, 09 Apr, 1.26 pma week ago4 weeks agoa week ago2 weeks ago

The 54 years old actress died due to accidental drowning in a bathtub in a hotel in Dubai. None of us ever imagined, that she will left the world so soon. The entire nation mourned on the sudden death of the diva who ruled the silver screen for more than three decades. Thousands of fans gathered on the street of Mumbai to bid farewell to their favorite superstars. Her death has raised lots of speculations. Now, another shocking detail has come out in open. In a recent interview, Sridevi's uncle, Venugopal Reddy revealed a few unknown things about her life. He said that Sridevi was living a miserable life with Boney Kapoor and she was not happy at all. He further added that Boney's mother never liked Sridevi and she was not happy with their marriage.     Born in a middle-class family, Sridevi became a star and married a famous producer, but according to her uncle, their financial condition wasn't that good. He said, "What we knew was Boney Kapoor lost a lot of money in few films and they sold Sridevi's properties to make up for the losses. And Sridevi always had that pain in her heart. Sridevi lived in pain and passed away with a lot of pain in her heart. She was not at peace. She wore a smile on her face for the world, but she went through a lot inside her. Boney produced a film which never saw the light of the day, and they were financially going through a tough phase. Sridevi sold her properties and cleared those debts to get life back on track. And that was the main reason why Sridevi got back to acting in films."   Venugopal also revealed that the actress went under the knife to enhance her features. He said, "Yes. she did get a couple of surgeries done on her nose. She traveled to the US and got the surgeries done on her nose since she wanted it to look good. We got to know this when we casually ask about her well-being while speaking to her mother over the phone."    Talking about Sridevi and Srilatha's differences, Venugopal revealed, "When her mother was operated in the US, the doctors performed the surgery on the wrong side of her brain because of which she was totally bedridden. She was alive but not in her senses. She had become just an object. After the family got to know about the surgery, they filed a case against the hospital and Boney Kapoor was along with Sridevi during this process. And court penalised the hospital, and sisters, Sridevi and Srilatha, had few differences in the allocation of that amount which was later cleared by the family members. And besides a share in this compensation, Sridevi used to send a lot of money to her sister Srilatha and they were fine."    He also shared Sridevi's equation with her step-son, Arjun Kapoor. He shared, "Sridevi did mention to few of her relatives that she did face few challenges with Arjun Kapoor, but I'm not too sure about it. When few of our relatives paid a visit to Sridevi, during their conversation she did mention that she was worried about daughters Janhvi and Khushi, about their future. Sridevi also mentioned that Boney wasn't well and his health was a bit worrying," Well, the truth behind Venugopal's story is true or not, we can't tell.

Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/u4uvoice-epaper-uvoice/7th+pay+commission+cpc+benefits+for+j+k+employees+explained-newsid-80007934| Jammu And Kashmir  7th Pay Commission: CPC Benefits For J&K Employees EXPLAINED | New Delhi, Jan 15: The government employees of Jammu and Kashmir state will receive benefits under the 7th Pay Commission or 7th CPC from April 1, announced the state Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu on Friday. The 7th Pay Commission recommendations will also be implemented retrospectively from January 2016 in Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, Finance Ministry has reportedly ruled out the possibility of a hike in minimum pay for the top and middle-level employees of central government beyond the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation. "I am committed to implementing 7th Pay Commission recommendations from April 1, 2018," Haseeb Drabu told the Assembly while presenting his fourth budget. He also announced the release of 1 per cent Dearness Allowance for government employees retrospectively from July 1 last year. The state government employees termed the announcement over the implementation of 7th Pay Commission's recommendations as 'a victory without war'.  "In general, it is the employee-friendly budget and we are thankful to the government for announcing the 7th Pay Commission. For us, it is a victory without war," Abdul Qayoom Wani, president of the Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC), told a Kashmir-based newspaper. Wani added that the employees were readying themselves to hit the streets if the government wouldn't have announced the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission. As far as a hike in minimum pay and fitment factor beyond the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for the central government employees is concerned, there is no clarity. There would be no hike in minimum pay beyond the recommendation of the 7th Pay Commission for the top and middle-level employees of the central government, a Sen Times report said quoting a top Finance Ministry official. "They will never be given hike in pay matrix above the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation because they do not need it," the official said. "The government have already reviewed the salaries and perks of the central government above the pay matrix level 5 and decided they do not need higher pay matrix levels," he added. The central government employees have been asking to raise minimum pay to Rs 26,000 and fitment factor 3.68 times from 2.57 times. The government had approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission on a hike in salary of central government employees in June 2016. The 7th Pay Commission had recommended a 14.27 percent hike in basic pay, raising minimum pay from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 month. Under the 7th Pay Commission, the basic salary of the lowest rank employee will be around Rs 18,000 and pay for the highest office of Chief second will be around Rs 2.25 lakh.     < Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 16 Jan, 11.28 pm

Nani will be seen in a completely out and out mass look for the first time in his career. The young hero is playing a dual role in the movie. Krishna, resembling a typical mass village youth, and Arjun, a young energetic Rockstar, who makes girls go crazy. The trailer hints that the film is high on all elements. Be it action, comedy, or romance, Krishnarjuna Yuddham has everything in it. God! Anupama Parameswaran looks cute, gorgeous, and beautiful too.    Anupama is likely to play opposite flamboyant Arjun, while another beauty Rukshar Mir will be seen opposite Krishna. Writing from Merlapaka Gandhi will surely glue the audience to the screen. After a long time, we will get to see humor going along with the movie.   The cinematographer, Karthik Ghattamaneni deserves a special mention. He managed to bring the variation while shooting for Krishna and Arjun characters in the film. The cinematographer filled the screen with village colors for Krishna, while stuck to stylish taking, with somber and cool combinations when it came to Arjun. Production values from Shine Productions are top notch. Going by trailer, Nani fans can start celebrating the movie's success.

Next Chief Minister of Tripura |  The BJP appointed Biplab Deb as the next Chief Minister of Tripura. The president of the BJP in Tripura, contested the elections from the Banamalipur assembly constituency in Agartala. He has been the State President of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Tripura since 7 January 2016. He contested the election from Banamalipur Constituency in Agartala, which was held by Indian National Congress MLA Gopal Roy. He also faced Communist Party of India (Marxist) youth leader Amol Chokroborty.  Biplab Deb led a door to door campaign in his constituency with senior leader Sunil Deodhar. He later returned to Tripura after an absence of 15 years. He was a former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteer and previously campaigned in elections to the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council. An interesting fact about Deb is that he worked as a gym instructor in Delhi when he had moved to the national capital for higher studies. Although he spent a considerable about of time in Delhi, the BJP decided to move him to Tripura as he is a local face. Prior to this he had worked as an assistant to Ganesh Singh, a BJP MP from Madhya Pradesh. Tripura BJP chief Biplab Deb Kumar after securing a historic mandate in the state on Saturday said he would abide by the party's leadership's decision if picked to lead the government in the state. Speaking to CNN-News18, Deb also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi, saying one doesn't remain a 'youth leader' after crossing the age of 50. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Deb said, 'Narendra Modi may have grey hair, but his thought process is that of a youthful person. Age is in the mind and Modi ii thinks like a young person.'

Drop in a mail to sexolve@thequint.com.This week’s Q&As below:‘I Had Sex With My Friend’s Sister’Dear RainbowMan,I am a 25-year-old man in a committed relationship with a woman. Two weeks have passed and I am unable to wrap my head around this or make any sense whatsoever. I feel suicidal and difficult to face the world for the sin I committed. I was at my best friend’s place. My friend was not around. His sister, two years my junior, was at home. We exchanged a few glances. We drank some wine. The music was playing on loop and soon we were all over each other. It started with a few hugs and a few pecks. One thing lead to the other, and we started necking and soon our clothes were off and we were fornicating like bunnies. All this while the fact that she was my friend’s sister seemed insignificant for me. I was high on emotion and couldn’t stop myself. Neither could she.We did this for over three hours, until we could hear my friend’s car, and we suddenly woke up to our senses, wore our clothes and started behaving as if nothing happened. My friend’s first question to both of us was “did you guys have a good time?”. I felt awkward, ashamed and stupid. His sister felt awkward too.I am not in love with his sister. I have a girlfriend. This was just one night. This was only one mistake. I am, however, feeling like a cheat. I have cheated on my friend. I have cheated on his sister. I have cheated on my girlfriend. To me fidelity is important. I went against my own principles. I am so ashamed. So damn ashamed.Upset Friend‘We did this for over three hours, until we could hear my friend’s car, and we suddenly woke up to our senses’.Dear Upset Friend,I hear you. I understand where you are coming from. I understand the feeling of guilt that seems like destroying you. You had set boundaries of commitment with your partner and feel horrible that you have gone further than what you agreed on with her. I also understand the fact that you feel you have let your friend down by rolling over the hay with his sister. I get that.I suggest that you quickly meet a counsellor, especially because you harbour the thoughts of suicide. You will get better. Things will get better. Hang in there. And seek help. I am telling you from personal experience, believe me, I have been seeing a shrink and my challenges have shrunken ever since and my perspectives have widened.I am not a fan of water tight committed relationships, but I understand that every lover will draw their own unique boundaries in any relationship with their partner/s. It is the responsibility of the lovers to honour that. However, it is also important that we understand that there could be genuine slip-offs. I am not your girlfriend, I can’t speak for her. But I would rather overlook physical infidelity, but hate it if my partner shares the same emotional space with someone else.I think your girlfriend deserves to know the truth. And you deserve to have a reserve of courage to accept her decision post that.You drove solo on the high road to fantasy, now stay back and be her passenger, as she takes the driver’s seat in this relationship.Regarding you letting your friend down – well, his sister and you are adults. From your statement it is clear that both of you consented to it and both of you wanted it at that moment. So I don’t see a reason why you should feel guilty. Just go with the flow.And yes, please don’t forget the counsellor bit. Please don’t neglect mental health. Here is a website that I wish you look at http://samaritansmumbai.com/. Please visit Samaritans Mumbai or call them for help.Love,RainbowMan‘I Don’t Feel the Urge For Sex’Dear RainbowMan,I am in a relationship with a very charming and passionate man. We have been together for three years, but we are yet to go “all the way” in the relationship. I don’t seem to be getting sexual with him. It is not that I don’t like him, I am not even remotely in the area of disgust, but I just don’t seem to have the appetite for sex where love and emotions are involved. I would much rather just have sex with a stranger and be more open about lusting the stranger than making love to my partner. My boyfriend is a little upset by this. How do I work around this?Sexy Lover‘I don’t seem to be getting sexual with him.’Dear Sexy Lover,There is a difference between ‘making love’ and ‘having sex’. ‘Making love’ has more emotions invested in the act as compared to ‘having sex’. Understand that while ‘having sex’ may happen at impulse, ‘making love’ would need a lot of time, dedication and empathy put into it for making it happen. I dont know what ‘all the way’ in your relationship means, for many it means penetrative sex, for some it means a blow job and for some others it is just being naked with each other.Please understand that a relationship will need a lot of understanding and confrontation of our inhibitions that come in because of invasion of personal spaces and emotions.It will be worthwhile to ask yourself – what inhibits you? Is it just that you don’t see love and making love in the same lens, it is your ideals or is it some other limiting factor? Do reflect.It is natural, that over time, your partner, no matter how open minded, would draw comparisons in his head. It is normal for him to assume you don’t love him the same way, if you think of making love with others, but not him. The worst is if he dwells in self-doubt and starts thinking “what have I done wrong” or “am I not good enough”.I am sure people who love understand the love. I am not saying that you are obligated to have sex if you are in a relationship, however, it is not that you don’t want to have sex either. Work on it. Maybe let yourself loose a little. Let him embrace a little. And reciprocate love with love. Body is just the extension of the mind. When minds make love, bodies can too.Smiles,RainbowMan‘My Husband’s Penis is Too Small’Dear RainbowMan,Is there a way to increase the size of my husbands penis? It is too small and I don’t get satisfaction.Worried Wife‘Is there a way to increase the size of my husbands penis?’Dear Worried Wife,There are methods of being satisfied even when someone has a smaller than usual penis. Kindly see a sexologist to seek assistance.I don’t know about penile enlargement capsules. There are many advertisements and it is difficult to say what is fake and what is true. Don’t fall into the trap of their gimmicks. Rely just on a professional doctor for advice on the same.Regards,RainbowMan.Dailyhunt	|Saturday, 24 Feb, 5.22 pmyesterday3 months agoa month ago2 months ago3 months ago

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

The biggest show in the WWE industry has always caught the imagination of the wrestling fanatics, and the just-concluded 34th edition also lived up to its billing. Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey making her in-ring debut was probably the show-stopper. She teamed up Kurt Angle to defeat Stephanie McMahon and Triple H in a thrilling bout. At the same time, some can say the main attraction of the night was the much-anticipated fight between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar defeated a bloodied Reigns to retain his Universal Championship Match. The event also saw the return of The Undertaker, as he made a winning comeback by thrashing John Cena.  In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history. It is safe to say that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the event.  A bloodied Reigns lost to Lesnar But amidst all this, something unfortunate happened. WWE star Natalya suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction during the event. After being thrown out of the rind during women's Battle Royal, she fell on the floor in an uncompromising position. The cameras were quick to point out the part which was visible, much to the embarrassment of Natalya.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

The trial court proceedings in Faridabad were halted after Junaid' family filed a petition in Supreme Court seeking CBI probe into Junaid's murder that took place last year in June on Mathura-bound train. Junaid was stabbed to death by the mob while his own brother and two cousins of Junaid all were brutally beaten up. Justice A B Chaudari allowing main accused Dass's bail plea granted him bail on Wednesday after the High Court has been dismissing his bail plea for the past five months.  Counsel for Dass, Senior Advocate Bipan Ghai, pleaded in the High Court that the trial court has "erred" in framing charges against Dass and it was "only a sudden fight over seat sharing".  Das was given the liberty to file a regular bail plea after five months by the High Court which the Court, in its order, observed, "There is every likelihood of prosecution witnesses being put in jeopardy" and directed the Sessions court to complete the trial proceedings within five months. The Trial Court on 11 October had framed charges under sections 298, 323, 341, 307, 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC and 145 of the Railway Act, against him for abusing the victims, using communal slurs during the fight. Dass was taken into custody last year on June 28. Other than the Prime accused Dass six other people were arrested in Junaid's lynching - Naresh Kumar, Ramesh Kumar, Rameshwar Dass, Pradeep Kumar, Chander Prakash and Gaurav Sharma. Now only Naresh Kumar is lodged in the prison while all other accused in the murder case have been acquitted. Seeking CBI probe, Junaid's father Jalaluddin, in his plea in Supreme Court alleged the investigation has been "subverted in a calculated manner" by the Haryana Police in order to help the main accused Dass Health Inspector to easily get bail. Naresh Kumar and main accused Dass is a Health Inspector in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi,were traveling in the same coach as Junaid's. These two allegedly got into the fight with Junaid and his brothers on board stabbing the 15-year-old Junaid to death.

"The standard of performances in some of the regional films is completely stunning. Hindi films cannot compete with them, not in the state they are... And I know why... Our Hindi films try too hard to become everything. These (regional films) are rooted," the director said while announcing the name of the winners.  Jayaraj won his second best director award -- this time for Malayalam film "Bhayanakam". He also won the best adapted screenplay award. Fahadh Faasil won the best supporting actor award for Malayalam film "Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum". The movie also won the award for best Malayalam film and took home the honour in best original screenplay category. Santhosh Raman got the award for best production design for "Take Off". Its actor Parvathy received a special mention. Kapur, known for films such as "Mr India" and "Bandit Queen", said after having served in the jury, he is ready to come back home and make movies in India. In the late '90s, the 72-year-old director turned to Hollywood and made award-winning films such as "Elizabeth" and "Elizabeth: The Golden Age". "My last film in India was 'Bandit Queen'. It was for a reason that I didn't make films in India. I wanted to make better films here. For years, I've been watching films and thinking that 'Nah... the standard of Hindi films is not that good. "I thought, 'Why should I go back? It should move forward and take up newer challenges'. But after 10 days of watching these films, talking to my jury members, I want to make a film in India." Kapur said films recognised at the National Awards were supposed to be enjoyed by both audiences and critics. "Awards are given not only to highlight the work done by the filmmakers, they are also given so that audiences actually go and watch the films. These films are not just meant to be viewed by film critics. "Why only allow the film critics to see the films? There is a very thin line between prejudice and judgement. Film critics are usually very prejudiced. You must watch these films. A lot of people have done a lot of hard work," he said.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/five+fascinating+facts+about+karnataka+rajyotsava-newsid-75615048| Home Five fascinating facts about Karnataka Rajyotsava | Karnataka state was formed on November 1 in 1956. Though Karnataka consists of people who are speaking different mother tongues (languages), have different food culture and diverse interests, there are many factors which unify everyone as a Kannadiga. Kannada Rajyotsava is the day to remind everyone why we are all one and despite differences, everyone is a proud Kannadiga. Here are five facts which make the celebration special and shows the unity of people.  1) The word Karnataka came into existence  The word Karnataka was used for the first time officially on November 1, 1956. Though the state was free, it was called Mysuru State prior to 1956. The name was changed because Mysuru was the name of the princely place ruled by Wodeyar kings. But there were many other provinces and regions which did not associate with the word Mysuru. Thus a neutral name Karnataka was given.   2) Who coined the word Karnataka?  According to etymologies the word Karnataka Desha or Karnataka was used in many literature books including in mythological books Sabha Parva and the Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic, The Matsya Purana, Skanda Purana, Markandeya Purana and the Bhagavata Purana. Scholars Pāṇini who was present from 520 BC to 460 BC mentions Karnataka in his works Mrichchakatika and Kathasaritsagara. Later, in the 5th century CE, the term Karnataka was used by the astrologer Varaha Mihira in his work Brihatkatha, and the Birur plates of Kadamba Vishnuvarma call Shanti Verma. Thus it is not known exactly who coined the term. But it is believed that various movements which were named Karnataka Ekikarana Samithi led to the leaders coming to a consensus to name the state Karnataka.  3) The regions in Karnataka were from many princely provinces  The regions that makeup today's Karnataka came under 20 different administrative units including the Princely state of Mysuru, Nizam's Hyderabad, The Bombay Presidency, The Madras Presidency and The territory of Kodagu.  4) Though the main language is Kannada, the state boasts of other languages too  Karnataka was majorly formed on the basis of the language spoken by the majority of the people-i.e Kannada. Most of the states in India have one language and different dialects of it. But Karnataka has people speaking different mother tongues. There are people speaking Kodava language, Tulu, Konkani, Beary and other languages. Even though small groups of people even demand a separate Tulu land or a Kodava land, by large everyone considers Kannada as the language of the state and celebrate the diverse culture and languages and are proud to celebrate Karnataka Rajyotsava which has united altogether.  5) Kannada flag  Though there are many cultures, languages, food habits which do not match with other regions of the state, a factor which unites everyone is the yellow-red flag of Karnataka. Wherever there is a programme, event or even protest irrespective of the region or the language, this flag is used by all making everyone Kannadigas -i.e. people of Karnataka.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/bayside+journal-epaper-baysidej/how+good+are+the+electric+bike+kits-newsid-78392279| Tech How Good Are the Electric Bike Kits? | The electric bike kit is a conversion equipment with a battery-powered electric motor that is used to convert a bicycle to an electric. The battery is rechargeable by simply plugging to the main electricity supply. Riding an electric bicycle is simple. You keep peddling until the electric motor kicks in. Then enjoy a stress-free ride. Personally, I believe that in these times of recession, one ought to prefer buying an electric bike conversion kit rather than opting for a brand new electric bicycle. This decision has many disadvantages. One of them is that this conversion kit is very cheap. Instead of spending a huge amount of money on an electric bicycle, I would simply convert my bicycle to an electric one. I don't need fuel to power my bike. When it runs down I recharge and ride on.  It is obvious that bicycle manufacturers greatly outnumber electric bicycle manufacturers. So, there are more brands of bikes than e-bikes. Buying a conversion kit gives you a chance to choose any bike that suits your lifestyle. A bicycle converted to an electric is lighter than a normal e-bike. You are also used to your bicycle, making riding easier and less stressful. The electric bicycle is suitable for a physical fitness program. If you want to burn extra calories without stress, just get an electric bike kit and use it for your keep fit exercises. Less stressful exercises of this sort can be very effective for the management of some disease conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis.

During rush hours you can make use of your e-bike instead of wasting time, fuel and energy using a car. You don't even need a parking space. Compared to the e-bike, buying the electric bike kit is far more economical. Do you have a bicycle? Then, spend a little money and buy an electric bicycle conversion kit. You will not only enjoy it but also will be proud of it.  Source by Garrick Baxter  Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 20 Dec, 5.51 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/inc42-epaper-inc/kunal+shah+is+looking+to+raise+30+mn+capital+for+his+new+venture-newsid-85135322| News Kunal Shah Is Looking To Raise $30 Mn Capital For His New Venture | Months after Freecharge founder Kunal Shah caused Twitter waves with his plans for a new startup in 2018, reports have surfaced that he is now looking to raise nearly $30 Mn in Series A funding for his startup.   Reports quoted people close to the development to reveal that Kunal Shah will raise funds from venture capital fund Sequoia Capital, Russian fund Ru-Net, fintech focussed fund Ribbit Capital and a few other investors for his new venture.  Of these investors, Sequoia and Ru-Net were investors in Kunal Shah's previous venture FreeCharge as well.   The speculations are also there that Shah's new venture might be an incubator or a lab in sectors like consumer finance, healthcare and education. However, on reaching out, Shah told TOI that "he was toying with multiple ideas and there was no formal shape to his company yet." When Shah first tweeted about his plans for a new venture, he suggested that he is looking at healthcare and education segments and got a lot more suggestions from Twitterati. Have a look!      Kunal Shah And His Endeavours  Shah started his startup journey with PaisaBack in 2010, and soon ventured as a co-founder to coupon-based app for mobile recharge, Freecharge. However, Freecharge was acquired by Snapdeal for $450 Mn in 2015, who then tossed it to Axis Bank for $60 Mn. Despite toss and play, Kunal Shah has remained an obvious choice for the Freecharge board to run the company. He has also been an active angel investor and has invested in a number of startups including Innov8, Gurugram-based used car marketplace Spinny, Zepo, Unacademy, Bharat Bazaar and so on. One of the several popular aspects of Kunal Shah is his Delta 4 theory which states, "Before implementing an idea, one must make sure that the business will be at least Δe = 4 to make it BragWorthy." In Kunal's terms, the Unique BragWorthy should always be greater than the USP of the idea. This will help save the entrepreneurs from making growth horizontally upward with the help of globalisation, instead of going for vertical intense growth which by far, very few personalities have achieved. As entrepreneur Kunal Shah looks around for ideas and capital for his new venture, we are looking forward to his idea and its inception, which might be an industry opener just like Freecharge.

The film reaches film halls today and the movie assures to be high on sentiments with a reasonable dosage of comedy tied in between.   If you are longing for a kind dosage of romanticism and quintessence, then actress Rani Mukerji's dramatic tale on teacher-student relation will satisfy your desire.      image source   'Hichki' is one of those motivating flicks, which careens dangerously between being strongly inspirational and insipidly utopian.   The actress dons the character of an unconventional teacher Naina Mathur who has Tourette Syndrome.   The actress has played the character in a perfect manner and showcases full grace in it.      image source   The film starts with her worrying track for a teaching rank. She's rejected in spite of being armed with numerous degrees as the determining authorities' panic that her chaos will stand in the approach of her education. The energetic Mathur doesn't take it lying down as she gives them a crash course on Tourette Syndrome unflinchingly.   After a gap of five years of thorough hunting, she lastly gets a job at a Catholic school whose naming originator St Notker had a speech problem. She's is employed to train 9F, a classroom of deprived rebels-slash-failures in this big educational institution.   It's sure a delight to watch Mukerji play Mathur with a blend of consummate conviction, grace and gravitas. It's easy to feel affectionate towards her aspirations and her avant-garde techniques of teaching. She's the kind of teacher who imparts physics lessons by bribing her pupils with boiled eggs. It works well.      image source   Actor Neeraj Kaabi dons the token snob who seems to be needlessly aggressive towards the pupils of 9F. His propensity to denigrate them seems needless and Mathur is always attempting to prove him erroneous.   Whilst the casting by Shanoo Sharma is dead right, the companionship and the link, which nurtures between the educator and the pupils appears forced. Their relationship doesn't feel organic that is one of the major disappointments of the film. But, the easy companionship between Mathur and her sib is tenderly genuine.   Whilst the film is aiming at communicating life-affirming philosophical systems like 'there are no bad pupils, but just bad teachers' and 'conquer your fear and fly free', there were special times in this play that are laboriously didactic.   The high point, which comprises cheating and a painful test as one of its plot twists, is also needlessly spectacular.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

The next flash sale for the Mi TV 4A is set for 12 PM on 17th April 2018, whereas the next flash sale of the Thomson Smart TV is set to take place at 12 PM on 18th April 2018.

All the three TVs also have a viewing angle of 178 degrees. The Thomson Smart TV and Vu Smart TV are rated for 450 nits of brightness, whereas Xiaomi hasn't provided max brightness figure. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Features The Xiaomi Mi TV 4A is powered by a quad-core Amlogic processor mated with 1GB of RAM. The TV also has 8GB of internal storage. The Mi TV 4A runs on a heavily customised version of the Android operating system, and it features Patchwall. The Patchwall merges content from all the media-streaming applications and set-top boxes in one pane. The Patchwall makes navigating and searching through the content easy. The Mi TV 4A also comes with an easy to use 12-button remote. The remote works on Bluetooth. Hence, the user doesn't need to direct the remote towards the TV for proper operation.

The Vu Smart LED TV also has the same connectivity options. The Thomson LED Smart TV also features three HDMI ports, two USB 2.0 ports, one 3.5mm audio jack, and one ethernet port, but it misses out on AV input. As for the wireless connectivity, all the three TVs have Wi-Fi b/g/n, but only the Mi TV 4A comes with Bluetooth connectivity option. Xiaomi Mi TV 4A vs Thomson LED Smart TV vs Vu LED Smart TV: Verdict From hardware specifications perspective, there isn't much difference between the three TVs; they have same spec display panels, same speaker output wattage, and almost similar connectivity options. However, the Mi TV 4A is a step further than the other two TVs with its Bluetooth connectivity and Patchwall feature. We think that going with the Mi TV 4A would be a wise choice.

Besides, Air India Express has around 555 slots at different local and overseas airports.  Moving ahead with the strategic disinvestment of Air India, the Civil Aviation Ministry has unveiled the broad contours for the process, including that the government would sell 76 per cent stake as well as transfer management control.  The low cost international arm Air India Express would be put up for sale apart from the national carrier's stake in AISATS, an equal joint venture with Singapore-based SATS.  Attractive slots at capacity-constrained airports and opportunities to increase international market share are among the highlights of Air India and Air India Express, as per the preliminary information memorandum issued on Wednesday for the proposed divestment.  In the voluminous preliminary information memorandum, the ministry has cited various 'key investment highlights' for the two carriers, including about slots.  Citing "under-utilised bilateral rights", it said there is huge potential for growth and increasing share in international markets. There is also "scope for improvement in utilisation of bilateral rights".  According to the memorandum, the two airlines have attractive slots at capacity constrained airports in the country.  "This is a significant advantage compared to any new player looking to enter or an existing looking to expand into the Indian market," the ministry said.  The national airline has 3,739 domestic slots and 2,543 international slots available per week as on December 31, 2017. In the Gulf and Middle East region alone, the carrier has around 280 slots available at various airports, including Abu Dhabi, Jeddah, Tel Aviv and Muscat.  During the same period, Air India Express had 555 slots at different domestic and international airports.  At the end of December 2017, Air India had an operating fleet of 115 aircraft while Air India Express had 23 planes.  The existing debt and liabilities of Air India and Air India Express as on March 31, 2017 would be re-allocated.  "It is expected that debt and liabilities, including net current liabilities of Rs 88,160 million, aggregating to Rs 3,33,920 million will remain with AI and AIXL (no change for AI-SATS except in normal course of business). This number shall be further adjusted to account for material business developments post March 31, 2017 for instance purchases/ delivery of aircraft etc.  "The balance debt shall be allocated to Air India Asset Holding Limited which is 100 per cent owned by the Government of India subject to receipt of requisite approvals from lenders and regulators, as applicable," the memorandum said. Contingent liabilities would remain with Air India and Air India Express.  Within the contingent liabilities, income tax, customs duty, as well as service tax and guarantee fee/ penal charges due to the government would continue to remain with Air India.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/inc42-epaper-inc/german+carpooling+app+wunder+enters+india+to+solve+the+problem+of+urban+mobility-newsid-74738431| News German Carpooling App Wunder Enters India To Solve The Problem Of Urban Mobility |   The German carpooling app Wunder has forayed in India and has recently launched a revamped version of its global app in line with the urban mobility needs of the Indian community. The app entered India in early 2017 with a soft launch in three cities viz. New Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai .  First launched in 2014 in parts of Europe, Wunder has already made its mark in cities such as Manila and Cebu of Philippines. The vision of the Hamburg headquartered company is to build a new form of the public transportation system for the most gridlocked cities in the world and solve the problems of urban mobility. Essentially, Wunder Carpool aims to position itself as an alternative to existing public transport mechanisms such as buses, metros and ride-hailing options such as Ola and Uber. The main purpose is to build a community which is aware of the urban mobility problems their country is facing and is willing to contribute to it. The Wunder carpool app thus aims to encourage people who are traveling in the same direction to share their rides as a community initiative to reduce pollution and decongest roads, rather than making it as an option to earn money. "If talked about India particularly, this is a real problem for not only the Tier I cities but also for the Tier II and Tier III cities. The only way forward is not to put more cars on the road going forward," says Rachit Shadra, Growth Manager at Wunder Carpool. With a team of 55 people of 26 nationalities, Wunder carpooling app has so far reached 700K global users and 300K Indian users. The startup has already raised Series B funding round and notes eminent investors such as Blumberg Capital, Piton Capital, iEurope, German Startups, and Cherry Ventures.  Wunder Carpooling App in India: Unwrapping The Revamped Version  After testing waters for almost six months in India, this week, the company launched a revamped version of the global Wunder Carpool app. As claimed by the company, the revised version is based on the feedback from over 200 community members in both India and Philippines, while picking up the most common ones. "We have been running our previous version in Manila for more than a year and a half, and have got a decent traction there. But, when we launched the same app in India, and we offered people to try the app, it was not good enough and they ended up not using it," he adds. The team then took a community first approach (like in every other market they have taken), to understand the exact issues and requirements of the people. Within a month, it figured out the certain specific issues and revamped the entire suite in sync with the needs of all its global consumers and the community.  The new version includes more safety features with added convenience and flexibility. For instance, there are now multiple verification levels for the drivers and co-passengers, while one can book a ride in just four clicks. Also, one can switch his profile to that of a driver or passenger as per the requirement. Here is a video to showcase the other new features added to the revamped version. As Rachit explains, "This is not something which you can use to earn money or make it an alternative to your job. While there is no restriction on usage of the app, the carpooling app is particularly meant to be an option which you can utilise for your daily commute to office or work. At the same time, you can contribute to the environment, plus the driver can get around 50% of the fuel cost shared per month."  Challenges Ahead And The Market Opportunity Wunder Found In India  Not only did the Wunder Carpool leadership team - Gunnar Froh (CEO), Samuel Baker (COO) and David Jeusette (CTO) find the Indian business landscape less confrontational, but also more welcoming compared to the other markets that they have come across. As per Gunnar, the basic factors they look for entering into any country are the openness of the people to let others share their private cars, Internet and smartphone penetration, friendly government policies towards the adoption of alternative methods of commute, level of acceptance to tech and the overall stability of the business environment. "The market opportunity in the carpooling segment is massive in India. Delhi alone, with a population of around 25 Mn has at least 10 Mn commutable trips. If you include the entire national capital region into this, then the number could possibly be at least 60% more. Add to it the other metropolitan cities of the country and you see the enormity of the opportunity available in this segment. Our primary mission is taking cars off the road in these cities to ease traffic congestion and hence, lower pollution levels," added David. Further, the primary differences that Wunder carpool team observed are on the basis of the local culture in India. For example, they found that the carpooling market in the Philippines is primarily driven by the spirit of sharing as a whole whereas the carpooling market in India is driven specifically by the sharing costs aspect of it. However, understanding the Indian market needs was not sufficient for Wunder and the team had to face its share of challenges. The biggest initial challenge that they faced was to build liquidity in the market. Since the app works on a marketplace model, it was extremely important to ensure that there was a stable supply of drivers for all the passengers being acquired who were willing to carpool and the other way around. "But, the biggest challenge that Wunder faces right now is its establishment as a viable alternative to ride-hailing companies. We are fully committed to solve the very real problem of traffic in the world's most gridlocked cities and we believe that carpooling is one of the only ways to reduce the number of cars on our roads," added Samuel.  The Ever Increasing Urban Mobility Load In Indian Landscape  In essence, the market opportunity for Wunder describes the urban mobility load India is bound to carry, despite taking several proactive measures.  If we go by the numbers,  by 2030, India will see the rise of some 68 urban sprawls, each with a population of more than 1 Mn, while Europe will see only 35. In sync with this, with all other issues, will come the problems of urban mobility including increased levels of congestion, pollution, inequality in access and more. If we go by particular cities, as per Mercer 2017 Quality of Living Index, Delhi is the worst among Indian cities while Bengaluru lies lowest in infrastructure. Further, as per NUMBEO Pollution Index 2017 mid-year, Delhi/ NCR has been ranked as the most polluted zone worldwide, while in terms of traffic congestion, all including Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru are ranked in top 20 worldwide. Furthermore, as per the latest reports, the carbon emission in India grew over 5% in 2015, even as global carbon emissions remained stable that year. Also, Climate Action Tracker, in its May 2017 report, has termed India's efforts to reduce global warming and reach its set targets under the Paris Trade Agreement as 'Medium.' If this is not sufficient to explain the severity of the issue, consider this. As per a report shared by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in June 2016, it is expected that passenger car ownership in India will grow by 775% over the next 24 years. "In the new policies scenario, passenger car ownership grows from less than 20 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants today to 175 cars per 1,000 people in 2040, and overall road passenger vehicle activity increases more than six-times," stated the above report. On one hand, this is a sign of economic growth and a number of opportunities for global car makers considering India to be a potential vehicle market in coming times. However, on the other hand, it is an alarming development from India's overall climate point of view.     Image Credit: GIM International   Solving Urban Mobility Issues: Initiatives Taken By Indian Government And Other Startups  The Indian government is proactively engaged in taking a number of initiatives to turn towards renewable energy sources for its power requirements. Earlier, the Supreme Court banned all commercial non-CNG cabs in Delhi NCR with effect from May 1, 201, to curb air pollution. Prior to that in January 2016, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal implemented the odd-even formula in New Delhi between January 1 and January 15, 2016. Only odd or even numbers of cars were allowed on the road, depending on the date.   Recently, in May 2017, NITI Aayog also came up with a 15-year roadmap for transforming vehicle use. As per a report released by NITI Aayog, "India could save as much as $60 Bn in energy costs by 2030 and one gigatonne of carbon emissions between 2017 and 2030 by adopting more electric and shared vehicles." India is also looking to sell only electric cars by 2030. However, this initiative comes with a big hurdle of establishing the infrastructure to facilitate smooth operations of electric cars, like setting up charging stations across the nation, etc. Further, in its latest initiative to solve the urban mobility issues, the Indian government also proposed to examine the use of private vehicles as taxis for carpooling. Apart from the Indian government, there are several startups and companies who are also helping the country in its drive to decongest roads and reduce pollution levels. On one hand, the leading automobile manufacturers like Ford, Mahindra & Mahindra, are busy building the required infrastructure to support the demand and supply of the future electric vehicle nation. On the other hand, there are startups like Jugnoo and ZoomCar who have recently introduced bicycle based services. For instance, Jugnoo has added 50 bicycles in the system that are doing deliveries in three cities - Chandigarh, Noida, and Gurugram. As claimed, with 300+ daily deliveries by these bicycles, Jugnoo has reduced the cost per delivery by 30%. Going a step further, after launching its self-drive car sharing services in 27 cities, ZoomCar has now introduced its technology-enabled cycle sharing service, PEDL. Zoomcar expects to cross 10,000 cycles on road in 2017 with much larger expansion plans to follow in 2018. After several weeks in the pilot, PEDL presently operates over 500 cycles in three cities - Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata.    Recently news also surfaced that Beijing-based bicycle sharing startup, Ofo, is set to enter the Indian market by the first half of 2018. Valued at $2 Bn, the unicorn recently launched operations in Adelaide. Earlier in September 2016, Ahmedabad-based transport company Chartered Speed reportedly entered into a partnership with Germany-based startup Nextbike, in a bid to launch a digital bicycle sharing platform in 100 Indian cities.  Editor's Note  The German carpooling app Wunder has entered India at a time when the efforts are being taken from all sides to curb the urban mobility issues. Although the timing is right and market opportunity seems bigger, one cannot deny the level of competition Wunder currently faces to position itself well in the Indian market.  However, the Wunder leadership team believes that the amount of data they possess is sufficient to give them an edge over existing peers. While local startups are limited to particular cities, their globally scalable model is an added advantage. Also, the Wunder app is already made on the premise that people in different cities even in India carpool really differently. For instance, in Delhi, there are very specific business hubs such as Noida, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, where people are usually living and then traveling to work. But Bengaluru has integrated business hubs within the city itself, and the people live much closer to their office, so the overall usage of the app is entirely different in every city, which Wunder is thus trying to leverage.  The company is currently not looking for monetisation but in near future has the options such as transaction fees, advertisements and using B2B modes to earn revenue. Aiming to hit 3 Mn trips globally by the end of 2017, in the near future, Wunder may also have the option to work with the Indian government, if they are able to make an impact on the market. Solving urban mobility issues is the need of the hour and India definitely needs more initiatives like Ofo, PEDL and the Wunder app. The way the Indian government has opened its gate for foreign startups solving these global issues will certainly inspire more such initiatives from homegrown companies too. While carpooling is just one part, it's time that the entire nation should come forward to help solve the urban mobility issues and makes its contribution in building a cleaner environment for the coming generations.

Honda took the wraps off the X-Blade at the Auto Expo 2018. It is powered by the same 162.71cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine as the Unicorn 160 and makes 14PS of max power and 13.9Nm of peak torque. It comes mated to a 5-speed gearbox. Expect it to hit showrooms in March with a price tag between Rs 75,000 - Rs 80,000 (ex-showroom). Read more about the Honda X-Blade here.X-Blade Adventure  After unveiling the X-Blade, Honda then moved on to showcase the X-Blade Adventure. Over the standard bike, it gets a larger windshield, a pair of crash guards and a sturdy carrier that replaces the pillion grab rail. The Adventure also has faux carbon fibre accents on the body around the fuel cap. But there is a catch. Honda may offer the accessories as additional fitment on the standard model, but only if the response at the expo is good. The company might also sell an "Adventure" kit that turns your X-Blade into a mild adventure tourer. Activa 5G  As promised, Honda launched the fourth model for the 2017-18 fiscal year, the 5th generation Honda Activa. Called the Activa 5G, the new scooter gets LED headlights, a remote seat-opening button and a semi-digital instrument console. Apart from that, it remains identical to the 4G in terms of both styling and mechanicals. Prices will be out in a matter of weeks and we are expecting a premium of Rs 2,000 over the 4G.2018 CBR250R  It's here! Honda has reintroduced the CBR250R in India. It has now undergone a BSIV update and updates like an LED headlamp and fresh graphics. Other than that, everything from the mechanics to the hardware has remained identical to the older bike. The CBR250R will now have a new rival in the market in the form of the TVS Apache RR 310. Expect the price to be close to the older model.  2017 MotoGP Bike  The Honda RC213V MotoGP race bike ridden by the 2017 champion Marc Marquez was on display at the Expo. It is powered by a 1000cc V4 motor that makes more than 241PS of power. For one season, a rider is given 7 of these powerplants, which the team has to use in 18 races. Specs aside, just standing next to the MotoGP-winning bike gives you goosebumps.PCX Electric Scooter  From the array of products at the Honda pavilion, the one which stood out was the PCX electric scooter. Powered by a high performance electric motor, which has been developed in-house by Honda, the PCX uses Honda's Mobile Power Pack with swappable batteries, charged separately. You can even attach two of these battery packs under the seat to get a longer range. While this is still a concept, Honda actually plans to employ this technology in its future electric products, which is pretty cool.  2018 CB Hornet 160R  As a part of the 2018 update, the CB Hornet 160R now gets LED headlights and new graphics. The fully digital instrument console, the sporty fuel tank, tank extensions and the chunky exhaust muffler remain unchanged. The X-shaped LED tail lamp has also been retained from the earlier model. No change in the power figures either.2018 CBR1000RR  Launched last year, the CBR1000RR Fireblade costs Rs 17.61 lakhs (ex-showroom Delhi) and is brought in as a completely built unit (CBU) in India. The 2017 CBR1000RR has 191 restless horses under that gorgeous exterior, which is 11 more than the older generation. Rivaling the Fireblade is the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R, Yamaha R1, BMW S1000 RR, Aprilia RSV4 and the Ducati 1299 Panigale. The CBR1000RR currently costs 17.3 lakh but could get cheaper thanks to the new duty reduction on CBU bikes . Get more details about the bike here . 2018 Goldwing  Also standing tall at the Honda pavilion was the 2018 Honda Goldwing. Launched at the very end of 2017, the flagship Honda for the country is priced at Rs 26.85 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). It is available in two variants - Gold Wing and Gold Wing Tour. The Goldwing Tour commands a price of Rs 28.49 lakh and gets a trunk, heated seats, electronic rear suspension preload and traction control. Both these bikes are only available in the showcased Candy Ardent red shade.CBR 250 One Make  The CBR 250 one make series bike also made an appearance at the Auto Expo. It is also a part of the ARRC racing series which travels around Asia. Apart from the obvious bodywork modifications the race bike also gets HRC's race ECU, which allows the team to use custom maps and also provides a 15 per cent power bump over the road bike. The bike also gets a host of track-spec features like a quickshifter, pit lane limiter and a shift light indicator.2018 Africa Twin  While all the mechanical parts remain the same the 2018 Africa Twin showcased at the Auto Expo had a few tricks up its sleeve. The showcased model had features like ride by wire with 3 rider modes, 2.3 kg-lighter battery, stainless steel spoke wheels, brand new instrument cluster, off-road-focused footpegs and a new emergency stop signal in the rear indicators. Prices for the 2018 model will be revealed soon. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 15 Feb, 4.02 pma week ago7 days ago3 weeks ago3 weeks ago2 weeks ago

After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Here's the whole story- it is said that during the first shot of the film Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum an officer pulled Fahad to the corner of a lockup and brutally hit him in the lower abdomen.  The actor bent over in pain and fell to the floor. But the Sub-Inspector soon came forward and held the actor in his hands, and everybody started to laugh, including Fahadh. It was the first scene in which Adoor CI Sibi Thomas was doing the role of SI Sajan Mathew. The inspector, who is a Circle Inspector in real life, was actually frightened whether he, in fact, hit the actor.     Even the whole location went silent for a moment and then burst into laughing. Fahadh was so natural and the actor himself had to assure the officer that it was only acting and he was not hurt.  Fahadh is one of the most talented young stars in the Malayalam film industry today. In just a few years, this 34-year-old has slowly but surely found firm footing in Mollywood and won the love of fans.  Now, he is all set to make a mark in Kollywood as well. He will soon be seen in Thiagarajan Kumaraja's yet to be titled film. The Annayum Rasoolum actor will also be seen in 'Velaikkaran' which is said to be an action-thriller and has been directed by Mohan Raja. It features Sivakarthikeyan and Nayanthara in the lead.

The system was introduced by Police and Transport Department in the city in August last to curb violation of traffic rules by fixing points for various violations, with the accumulation of 12 points to mean punishment in varying degrees. The RTA's latest update for the mWallet will help users know how many points they had accumulated, since exceeding 12 points could cancellation of driving license.  It was only earlier this month that one person finally accumulated more than 12 points, 14 to be precise, resulting in the police issuing a notice to him, with action on his licence to be decided shortly. Most of the violations in that particular case were related to not wearing helmets. "After updating the app with the penalty point system, it has become more helpful for motorists making them aware of points that they had crossed and urges them to be careful while driving," said Rudra Teja, developer of mWallet. The app is already one of the most popular government mobile apps, having registered nearly 25 lakh users with a rating of 4 stars out of 5 on Google Play Store. On the other hand, there are 2, 500 to 3,000 new users being registered every day, thus making the app the most downloaded one in any State, officials said. After the integration of e-challan with mWallet, citizens are coming forward to pay their fines through the app, they said. The department is now working on integrating the pollution certificate as well in the app. J Panduranga Naik, Joint Transport Commissioner, said: "The positive feedback for the app is encouraging the department to work more on it. There have been suggestions to add an option to include the pollution certificate as well and we are working on it." Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 17 Jan, 1.19 am

Most offer free music, and charge as little as Rs 29, or less than 50 cents, a month for ad-free access. Even Spotify, the No. 1 service in the U.S., plans to join the crowd.   The hope stems from cheaper and faster data driven by the nation's richest man Mukesh Ambani. His Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. unleashed a tariff war in the world's second-largest telecom market where a third of 1.3-billion Indians now own smartphones. That created a nascent market of users who don't mind paying. The number of people listening to songs legally online, according to an EY report, is expected to jump threefold to 273 million by 2020.   Yet, getting users to pay will be a challenge. Pirated content continues to be the most popular source of music. Indians visited websites providing unlicensed music 9 billion times in 2017, according data shared by analytics firm MUSO to BloombergQuint. It's a threefold jump over the previous year as the nation continues to lead the global music piracy chart. Clamping down on websites offering pirated songs has worked only partially.   Still, the opportunity is huge and all streaming players are working to build a habit, said Siddhartha Roy, chief executive officer of Hungama. "We believe it's just phase one playing out where customers are getting comfortable. Habit will eventually lead them from the free to the paid model."   Streaming apps helped the Rs 1,280-crore ($190 million) music industry struggling to tackle unlicensed use. Just like Spotify did in the U.S. That's because apps pay music labels and companies a fee for getting access to their archives.   The industry had stagnated and digital platforms have given it a fresh momentum, said Vikram Mehra, managing director at Saregama India, which has one of the largest music archives in India. "Easy availability of content has led to more and more people listening to music legally.    In the last three years, not just in India but globally the entire music industry, including labels, is growing and the credit goes to the streaming world.  Vikram Mehra, Managing Director, Saregama    In the last three years, not just in India but globally the entire music industry, including labels, is growing and the credit goes to the streaming world.  Vikram Mehra, Managing Director, Saregama   Also Read:  Reliance Buys Stake In Saavn, Merges Music Apps   Nine music apps in the country account for a large part of the company's overall business-to-business sales, Mehra said. And most music labels have shifted to digital distribution. Physical sales contribute just 11 percent of the industry revenue, EY said citing IFPI Global Music data. That compares with the global average of 34 percent. Deloitte had in 2015 estimated the digital music market will touch Rs 3,100 crore (about $470 million) in India by 2020.  Not an easy ride  The number of people listening to music online has more than tripled since 2015. Yet, most tune in as long as it's free and getting them to buy a monthly subscription has proved difficult. Of roughly 87.6 million users last year, according to EY, only 2 percent paid.   Emailed queries to Saavn, Wynk, Amazon music, Gaana and Google seeking revenue and paid user details remained unanswered.   "Monetisation is a challenge," said Frank D'Souza, partner and leader, entertainment and media, at PwC India. "It's difficult to get customers to pay for services as they are used to getting content at a very low or no price. Changing this behaviour is challenging."   At the same time, the content cost is going up with increasing competition. Raghav Anand, head for digital, media and entertainment at EY India, said it will continue to rise till the platforms reach a more mature subscriber base.   That's why D'souza of PwC expects standalone music streaming businesses to find it harder to get customers to pay compared to players that offer a bundle of services.    Music is better as an adjunct than a standalone offering if you are looking for the long haul. That's the only way to keep your customers engaged on the platform.  Frank D'Souza, Partner, Entertainment And Media, PwC India    Music is better as an adjunct than a standalone offering if you are looking for the long haul. That's the only way to keep your customers engaged on the platform.  Frank D'Souza, Partner, Entertainment And Media, PwC India   This is where the likes of Amazon Prime, Google Music and Apple Music will have an advantage. Even Bharti Airtel Ltd.'s Wynk and Reliance Jio offer more than just songs. And it will be a challenge to stand out in the crowd.   Also Read:  Saregama's Retro Bet Sends Its Shares Soaring   There is enough room for multiple players, Anand said. But if Indian platforms are banking on volumes, it is going to be difficult. "You can get the first 5-10 million customers. But if you want to do the volume subscription play, these players need to step outside India. Something that global OTT players (like Netflix) have done."   Spotify will only increase competition. The Swedish company, considered the Netflix of the music industry, has grown exponentially by convincing people to listen to recorded music at a reasonable price. What makes it click is its use of data analytics to make suggestions to users.   Yet, it won't have the first mover advantage in India. "The biggest challenge will be to get the customers to pay and at what price," D'souza said. "Getting regional content will be another big question."

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asian+age-epaper-asianage/real+life+rape+videos+new+porn+in+uttar+pradesh-newsid-76840119| Headlines Real-life rape videos new porn in Uttar Pradesh | The 'local films' he is referring to are real-life rape videos that are now the fastest selling commodities in this market.  Lucknow: It is 10.30 am and most of the shops in Naka Hindola market - known as the grey market for electronic goods in Lucknow - are yet to open. Inside a dusty lane, a man peeps inside a partially lifted shutter and says, "Paanch local film chahiye - achche wale. Sham ko aaunga" (I need five local films-will come in the evening), and walks off. The "local films" he is referring to are real-life rape videos that are now the fastest selling commodities in this market. These rape videos are sold clandestinely only to known customers in blank covers. To make the business more discreet, most of these videos are sold in USB pen drives.  Rapes are now video recorded not just to blackmail the victim, but also because it is a lucrative commodity that can be sold many times over.  The harrowing business is flourishing right under the nose of the police - the Nkaa Hindola police station is barely 500 metres away from these shops - and sources claim that the cops receive a hefty amount on a monthly basis for ignoring the business. Rakesh (name changed), who runs the sleaze business explains, "The days of pirated films are over. It is now the rape videos that are in demand. The trend of filming a rape is gaining ground and most of these are cases of gangrapes. The duration is anything between 10 minutes to 30 minutes and the video clip is sold for anything between Rs 300 to Rs 500, depending on how explicit it is". These videos are made available to those in the business of selling by their agents in various cities. "Our men buy these videos for Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 and we 'clean up' the clips before putting them out in the market. The clean up means that the faces of the rapists are blurred, but the victim's face is not. Those that have an audio track (read screams) are more expensive," said Rakesh. He even admitted that there is a possibility of this business actually encouraging gangrapes. Porn is passé. Real-life crime is the rage. The demand for these clips has grown to such an extent that buyers are coming from adjoining states like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar with bulk orders. Sadistic pleasure, then, is not restricted to Uttar Pradesh. Sellers in Lucknow claim to sell 100 to 200 "local films" every day. Those in the business say that their customers are mostly young boys and students and also those with political links, which further boosts and legitimises their "business". With the state government providing free Wi-Fi at most public places, the business has received an impetus. And the complicity of police is being bought.  Sellers of rape videos claim that they give a fixed amount of money to the cops every month, which allows them to conduct their business smoothly. The cops, however, feign complete ignorance about the business. A senior police official of the rank of ADG, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "Now you know why certain police stations are much sought after by the cops - it is the money that comes in. In more than 50 per cent of rape cases, the victims complain that the act was filmed by the accused, but the police never register the case under IT Act." It is clear that there is a nexus which cannot be easily broken". Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 23 Nov, 6.51 am

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm3 months ago4 days ago2 months ago

Their each move, strategy and game plan on the field is keenly followed without a miss. Such is their popularity even off the field that their personal life isn't spared either. And when we look closely at the personal life of cricketers, we find another side which is sometimes dark. While some have got involved in ball tempering, match-fixing and other on-field scandals, some other have got involved in shocking sex scandals which dented their personal as well as professional lives. Here are some star cricketers who were caught in sex scandals.  1. Shane Warne    Time and again, the king of spin, Shane Warne has proved that he is also the king of scandals. From harassing British nurse Donna Wright, to getting naughty with 25-year old models, to having fun with a Melbourne stripper, to having extra marital affairs, to kissing his girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley openly in stadium during IPL 2011, he has number of controversies to his name. 2. Chris Gayle    The Jamaican beast, known to be a party animal, garners much attention both on the field and off it due to his charming personality. He made his name to the list when he was found 'socialising' with three British women in his Sri Lankan hotel room during the ICC World T20 2012. During an interview with journalist Charlotte Edwardes of The Times Magazine, he bragged about his "very, very big bat". During World Cup 2015, a lady staff accused him of flashing his genitals. 3. Kevin Piertersen    The cricketer was dating the 'Playboy' model and 'Big Boss' contestant Vanessa Nimmo. Their relationship didn't work out for more than a month and Kevin dumped Vanessa. The heartbroken model decided to wash off the image of cricketer by revealing how Kevin was a sex addict who often pestered her to get on bed. 4. Ian Botham    Sir Ian Botham is one of the best-all rounders to ever play the game and one of the very few players to receive knighthood. But it seems, he is not that perfect in his personal life. He cheated on his while having an affair with an Australian waitress. He also had a scandalous affair with former Miss Barbados Lindy Field. 5. Shahid Afridi    Because of his good looks, Shahid Afridi enjoys massive popularity amongst his female fans across the globe. And probably that's because he got himself on the list. Before leaving for a tournament in Singapore with the Pakistani team, Afridi - along with teammates Hasan Raza and Atiq-uz-Zaman - was caught in a Karachi hotel room with a group of young women. The players claimed to be innocent but Pakistan Cricket Board dropped all three players from the squad for ICC Champions Trophy that was held later the same year. 6. Herschelle Gibbs    His personality is so charming that he easily finds a mention every time we talk about bad boys of cricket. In his autobiography, To The Point, he gave numerous of accounts of his own sex life. Describing one such instance ahead of World Cup 1999 group game against Australia, Gibbs wrote: "I just knew I was going to get a century. Perhaps the girl lying in bed beside me had inspired me. She worked at the hotel, where I had befriended her. I guess she was my lucky charm - she certainly was when it came to my batting. I just wish her powers had extended to my fielding and the bladdy dropped catch." 7. Mike Gatting    Former England captain and the recipient of Warne's "ball of the century", Mike Gatting was accused by the media for his illicit involvement with a barmaid, Louise Shipman, in his hotel room during the first Test against West Indies at Trent Bridge. He maintained his innocence but the Englsih cricket authorities didn't buy his version of truth. 8. Daryl Tuffey    Playfully known as Darly 'Huffy-Puffy', this New Zealand bowler was caught in a sex scandal in the year 2005 when two English tourists filmed him having sex with a 23-year-old girl. After the incident, the English tourists never came in front and even his hook-up claimed that she never met Tuffey. 9. Mohammad Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq    These Pakistani cricketers visited a local strip club named 'club 69' in South Africa which cost them a lot. It was believed that they got into a fight in the club and were beaten badly. But it was presented that the cricketers was 'mugged' outside their team hotel 'Sandton' and got hurt. 10. Asad Rauf    Pakistani umpire and then a part of ICC elite panel of umpires, Asad Rau made the headlines when a when a 21-year-old Indian model Leena Kapoor accused him of "sexually exploiting" her on the pretext of marriage. However, Rauf claimed that she was just a fangirl. But he couldn't prove his claim as numerous intimate pictures of the couple were surfaced on the internet.

Most of us love to enjoy cricket match and stay curious about the wickets, sixes and everything. Shahid Afridi holds the record for longest six in International cricket lasting as long as 158 meters against South Africa, 3rd ODI at Johannesburg on March 17, 2013. There’s nothing quite as spectacular as watching someone hit a six in cricket.  * Shahid Afridi It is not surprising to see Shadid Afridi on this list again. After all, many people remark him as the King of Sixes, boasting the highest Strike Rate and the most number of sixes in ODI Cricket.   * Yuvraj Singh Yuvraj was one of the architects behind India’s victorious T20 and 50 overs World Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2011 respectively. Many cricket fans admire Singh’s stylish play, and they certainly admired the six he hit on 22nd September 2007 during the World Twenty20 against Australia.  * MS Dhoni Next we have another one of the most impressive sixes hit by MS Dhoni. This occurred on March 8th in 2009 during India’s tour to New Zealand. The match was the third ODI for India and when the Indian skipper hit the breath-taking six, he didn’t even look at the ball once it left his bat.  * Corey Anderson Corey James Anderson is an all-rounder who hails from New Zealand but currently plays for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Last year, Corey Anderson introduced himself on the International scale on January 19th. He hit a ball on the roof of Napier for New Zealand against India. He powered New Zealand to 292 with four sixes, two of which were out the ground.  * Chris Gayle Chris Gayle is a Jamaican cricketer who captained the West Indies’ Test side from 2007 until 2010. He once held the record for the highest score in a World Cup, with 215 runs. Chris hit the biggest six of the entire World Twenty20 tournament in 2010 at Bridgetown. On May 9th, Gayle hit a stunner on the bowling of Yusuf Pathan.Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 21 Dec, 6.14 am

The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well.

If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane.

The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/shocking+your+favourite+idli+can+cause+cancer-newsid-69060145| Home Shocking: Your favourite idli can cause cancer | The researchers and environmentalists argue that the idlis prepared using plastic covers instead of cotton cloth while baking is the potential threat to human life as plastic emits harmful microns in heat. This micron, when makes an entry into the human system, can cause cancer.Professor and Head of The Department Chemistry, CMR Institute of Technology, Dr Phani Kumar Pullela said, the new journal of medicine has already made publications of the harmful impact of plastic coming into contact with humans.Food and beverage containers, some disposable plates, and toiletry bottles made of plastic have chemicals. Research suggests that all plastics may release chemicals if they're scratched or heated. Research also strongly suggests that at certain exposure levels, some of the chemicals in these products, such as Bisphenol A (BPA), may cause cancer in people. "The same concept has to be applied in cooking idli. If the idli is cooked using thin plastic, there is a high chance of suffering from diseases including cancer. The plastic residues may leak into food substance when exposed to heat. The plastic emits harmful carcinogens when food is cooked or is heated in plastic items. In the long run, people will get infected with cancer as well," said Dr Pulella.Agreeing with Dr Pullela, Dr Linge Gowda, Director of KIDWAI Memorial Institute of Oncology, says, it is beyond an iota of doubt that plastic when exposed to heat releases harmful carcinogens which cause cancer."Consumption of food cooked in aluminium, steel, earthen pot or copper is safe. We have noticed people using plastic glass to drink roadside tea, and also people eat food like idli cooked using a plastic sheet in the cookware. The hotels and roadside stalls were earlier using a cotton cloth to avoid batter getting struck to idly cooking plates, but now, the plastic sheet is being used in most of the eateries. In the long run, this will have an impact on health. Hence we suggest that the local and municipal authorities must impose penalty on such eateries," he said. Dr Nirmal Buggi, Chief Health Officer of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, has directed all the 198 health inspectors to check eateries in their respective jurisdiction and impose penalty for use of plastic in cooking. "The plastic above 40 micron and micro wave safe vessels are only allowed to cook and serve food when it comes to use of plastic. The roadside shops are aware that using such plastic in cooking and also while covering the serving plate can cause negative effects on health. Yet, they do not comply with BBMP rules," he said.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/hackers+break+into+naukri+com+steal+over+1+l+resumes-newsid-84435702| Bangalore Hackers break into Naukri.com, steal over 1 L resumes | Nigerian hackers have broken into the Naukri.com server and have stolen nearly one lakh resumes. The incident came to light after an IT firm 'Klaus' which manages Naukri.com's server registered a complaint with the CID Cyber Crime division. Officials from the CID Cyber Crime cell had written a letter to the company's headoffice in Mumbai seeking an explanation about the hack. Kalus IT Solutions representatives stated in their complaint that Naukri.com had outsourced the work of maintaining their server with the city-based IT firm over a period of time. Klaus charges Naukri.com anywhere between Rs 3 and Rs 5 to maintain each resume of millions of job seekers who register on Naukri.  The complainant also stated this is the first time the server has been hacked. Soon after they came to know about the hack, the firm took measures to protect the remaining existent database of the server. But by then, a lakh resumes were already stolen, they said in the complaint. Preliminary investigations by Cybercrime cell revealed the IP address of the laptop used for hacking originated from Nigeria. On the Naukri.com website, there is an option called 'New to Naukri' for first-time job seekers. On this option, one can upload an attachment sized 2 MB which goes to the server managed and maintained by Klaus IT Solution in the City. Klaus then retrieves the resumes from the server and matches them with requirement from companies to intimate them about job offers. Cybercrime sources said, initially, the hackers hacked the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) of the Naukri website and later they breached their server. The police suspect that within three days, the hackers downloaded at least three lakh resumes. Looting job-seekers Using the information on the stolen resumes, hackers are now contacting job aspirants faking that they are from reputed multinational companies. They are luring job seekers into paying money for back-door entries. There have been several reports of job aspirants who were cheated in a similar manner and complaints have been lodged. The hackers have used the names of companies such as Wipro, Bosch, Airtel, Accenture, and many others. If one responds to their mail, they are next asked to pay up for registration, interviews. Nearly 10,000 job aspirants have been contacted and attempted to be cheated. Senior police officials from the Cybercrime cell said job aspirants need to be careful while responding to such e-mails and verify the authenticity of the emails before they go ahead with the job offer. A few of the job aspirants have also started receiving calls stating that they were from banks and they could process loans if they are interested. Out of 808 complaints registered before the Cybercrime cell until March 23, 250 complaints were related to fake job offers and bank loans. Since Kalus IT Solutions is a vendor company involved, we have written to the chief of Naukri.com to come and register a formal police complaint, said a Cybercrime official.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/these+16+stars+disclosed+unbelievable+secrets+about+their+sexual+lives-newsid-73873880| Celebrities These 16 Stars Disclosed Unbelievable Secrets About Their Sexual Lives |  Their bold confessions will leave you utterly shocked!  What do you think is the difference between the traditional Bollywood stars and the young ones?  The one that I noticed is that earlier, Bollywood celebs were supposed to keep their personal lives a secret. But now an overflow of stars can be seen slowly opening up a lot more to the world. Right from Alia Bhatt to Deepika Padukone and from Ranveer Singh to Anurag Kashyap, everyone has confessed about the things which are called to be taboo in Indian society. They revealed their extramarital affairs, one-night stands and even their sex position or other feelings on the same.  They have broken the hard shells and stereotype mentality of their fans by sharing these secrets. So, let's start with the young Alia Bhatt who shared her most personal desire related to sex. These confessions will give you quite a shock that you would be rooted to the spot. Alia Bhatt, the star of the films, Udta Punjab, Dear Zindagi and Kapoor And Sons never revealed her relationship status with co-star Sidharth Malhotra in public. But it was rumoured that the couple had parted ways. In an interview with a famous magazine, Alia said, "If a relationship has ended, it is obviously for a reason. If it was not supposed to end, then he will come back. I always believe that if a person is meant for you, he will return to you."   When she was asked about her favourite sex position, this is what she replied...   Alia showed her naughty side and revealed to Mid-Day that her favourite sex position is 'the classic missionary' because she is 'a simple person'. When asked what she would first check if he left his phone unlocked, she said that she should know the password to her boyfriend's phone.  Sonam Kapoor is known for her blunt replies and straightforward beliefs. But according to Deccan Chronicle, on a chat show, she showed some concern about her brother and said, "He has terrible taste in women. I never say this to him directly. He has decided he does not want to date girls who are like Rhea and me."   The Ranjhanaa actress along with sister Rhea Kapoor had sent messages to Harsh expressing their concern about him using protection. She said, "She's sweet but tacky; Not bad, but you can do better; We hope you're using protection; Why do you have such bad taste in women?"   Ranveer Singh never hesitates to share his sexual experiences with his fans. Once in an interview, he claimed that he was 12 when he lost his virginity. He said, "I think I was around 12 when I did it. I started everything early, everything! I was way ahead - so much so that in school all the mothers used to say he (Ranveer) is that rotten apple that's spoiling all our kids. I used to hold sermons with all the boys surrounding me, and I used to teach them."   According to India Today, Ranveer Singh, who is the first A-list Bollywood actor to endorse a condom brand, says he always carries a condom in his wallet.  Ranbir is already being called the face of Bollywood's next generation. Talking about his past life, Ranbir said, "There was marijuana, there was alcohol, I started smoking cigarettes."    "I must have been around 15 years old when I lost my virginity," said Ranbir Kapoor in an interview with a well-known magazine.  According to the sources, Salman Khan has dated actress Katrina Kaif, but after years of speculation, Kaif admitted in an interview in 2011 that she had been in a serious relationship with Salman Khan for several years, but it ended in 2010. Sangeeta Bijlani and Somy Ali were also in serious relationships with Khan.   "I am a virgin," he said in the popular show Koffee With Karan in 2013. He also shocked his fans by his statement, "I am going to save myself for the one that I get married to." According to Deccan Chronicle, in 2016, on the same show, "You're still a virgin?" Karan asked. "Yes, nothing's changed. Still a virgin and so are you, Karan," came Salman's reply.  Arjun Kapoor who believes love is happiness, friendship and compatibility, if you are truly happy it must be love.   But in an interview about what is more important food or sex, he said...   According to Filmfare, when Arjun was asked about the ugly truth about men, he replied, "That they rate sex over love. Sex is more important than love for men."   Twinkle Khanna is known as Miss Funnybone of the Industry. Twinkle and Akshay have been married for 16 years and have two children, son Aarav and daughter Nitara. About their marriage, Twinkle said, "I think it's a great team. We are playing tennis doubles, and I think that's a pretty good foundation for a marriage to last."   When asked about sex, she replied...   According to the sources, on the importance of sex in a marriage, she said, "Sex is important at every stage." Twinkle even added a witty comment that, "The things that I find attractive in Akshay have changed over the years."   The film and television actor Sushant Singh Rajput started his career with television serials and now he is one of the most desired and talented faces of Bollywood. There have been rumors about him being in a relationship with Ankita Lokhande and Kriti Senon. But what is more shocking is his reply to the question, "What is your favourite sex position?"   According to Dainik Bhaskar, Sushant Singh Rajput, in an interview, made a confession when he was asked about his favourite sex position. The actor was pretty straightforward to reveal that it was 69. "I like things in 60, so it has to be 69," Sushant claimed.  After ages of being in the 'neither admitting nor denying' phase, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have finally moved forward and accepted their relationship status in public. You have already read what Ranveer has to say about his ideas about sex, now let's see what Deepika feels about it.  During an interview, she spoke about emotional attachment while having sex. She said, "For me, sex is not about getting physical; there are emotions involved."   Gorgeous and stunning Nargis Fakhri, despite being a newcomer (who could barely speak Hindi) has made it into Bollywood and even survived in the industry for a long time has some different views about relationships.   According to her...   According to Dainik Bhaskar's report, Nargis claimed, "Sex is so important that if you aren't getting enough of it, get out of the relationship."   Emraan Hashmi is known for making the most honest confessions. It takes a person who is confident in his own skin to own up to something like that. Emraan is an immensely talented actor and has given us some real-powerful roles.    "As a married man, I miss one night stands," says Emraan Hashmi, whose sex scenes are the USP of his movies.  The Ooh La La girl, Vidya Balan On 14 December 2012, got married to Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures in a private ceremony. She spilt a secret about women that will absolutely shock you.   According to sources, when Karan Johar asked Vidya about that one secret about women that men don't know, she said, "We like it, need it and want it as much as they (men) do!"   The couple Kashmira Shah and Krushna Abhishek become parents to twin boys through surrogacy earlier this year in June. The new mommy who is known for her blunt statements disclosed her favourite sex position in an interview that will leave you stunned.   According to sources, Kashmira shared about her favourite sex situation. She said, "My favourite sex position is 'Doggy Style'"   Kalki Koechlin revealed that she had been sexually abused when she was just 9 years old. "I felt it was my mistake and so I kept it hidden for years," she said.   According to India Times, during a conversation, Kalki disclosed how she was once a victim of sexual abuse. She said, "I allowed someone to have sex with me at the age of nine, not understanding fully what it meant."   Govinda is one of those celebrities who confessed about their private life secrets to the media. But he still believes that some things are better hidden from the public.   "I have had extramarital affairs," he said, but he didn't go on to reveal the exact facts.  Anurag Kashyap, Indian film director, writer, producer and actor disclosed one of his nightmares according to a report by India Times. He thanked his ex-wife Kalki Koechlin for helping him completely cure the acrimony.   He revealed that...    "I met the man who molested me as I was a child," he said. Sharing the torture, he added, "I met him after many years. He wasn't some dirty old man. He was 22 when he abused me. He was guilt-ridden when we met. I decided to put the whole nightmare behind me and move on."  Kudos to these brave stars who have the guts to step out and reveal to the world their darkest secrets and share the most difficult moments of their lives. I hope you liked the story.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Like the Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood – the Bengali film industry produce many good films. Like they are bold movies in every industry, the Bengali film industry has also produced many bold movies. Here, is a list of 5 Bengali movies that have crossed the limits of nudity and boldness. Chatrak (2001) This Bengali film, stars Anubrat Basu and Paoli Dam. The film was struck many controversies for the number of intimate frames. How do the makers of such films think that the movie can be watched with the family? Or maybe the maker doesn’t need people to watch the movie happily.   Cosmic Sex (2014) Having a storyline that revolves around s** and spirituality. The actresses of the film also won ‘best actress award at Osian’s Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema’. Bold one. But, good for nothing. It must be noted that the directors of such films can take some responsibility and avoid taking such films.  Khawto (2016) The romantic thriller stars Prosenjit Chatterjee, Paoli Dam and Raima sen. The plot of this story is the sexual relationship of novelist Nrbed Lahiri and the character of a women in his book. I don’t understand the moto of the director of such films. Seriously. Don’t they understand how vunerable the minds of little kids towards such obscene films.!  Chhip Suto Char The plot of the movie is the romantic drama that goes around four young girls. Young girls portraying such characters, may actually send wrong kind of message to the society.  Chitrangada: The crowing wish The film tells the story of the people that strive or struggle a lot with their gender identity. The movie has a lot of nudity and obscene frames.  And these were some Bengali movies that are absolutely bold with lot of nudity and obscenity in different frames of the film.  Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 17 Sep, 1.36 pm
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/2020+toyota+corolla+altis+this+is+what+it+could+look+like-newsid-84042097| CarToq 2020 Toyota Corolla Altis: This is what it could look like | Toyota has been busy testing the next-gen Corolla sedan in the United States. The all-new model will likely go on sale in India in 2020 and will be a complete model replacement of the current Altis. A couple of renders of the upcoming new model surfaced online recently. As per these speculative renderings, the new Corolla would look a lot like the recently revealed Toyota Auris hatchback whilst retaining some of the DNA of the current-gen model. The silhouette of the upcoming car even reminds us of the new Camry, which made its public debut early last year. The current engines look likely to be carried over to the next-generation model. Hence, the current 18-liter four-cylinder petrol and 1.4-litre diesel engine could be carried over with a slight variation in power delivery and fuel efficiency. While the petrol engine will come mated to a 6-speed manual transmission as well as an optional CVT, the Diesel engine will come with a 6-speed manual 'box only. The 2020 Corolla Altis will be built on the same Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform as the new Camry, Prius, C-HR, and other new cars from the Japanese giant. The new platform will make the car significantly lighter, thereby enhancing its performance and fuel efficiency.     Further details are scarce but you can safely expect the 2020 Toyota Corolla Altis to offer more features. Going by the upcoming Yaris sedan, which will launch in India in near future, the all-new Corolla Altis is likely to offer class-leading features. The Yaris, on the other hand, will find itself slotted between the current Corolla Altis and the Etios. It will go on to rival the likes of Maruti Suzuki Ciaz and Honda City. The Yaris will be offered with a petrol engine option only but will offer a choice of manual and automatic transmissions. You can safely stay tuned to Cartoq for more details on the upcoming 2020 Toyota Corolla Altis and also on the Yaris sedan.

Krishna Menon, The 'Hero Of Kashmir' | Let Us Know About The Hero Of Kashmir: Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar and Rajendra Prasad are some very well known names in Indian Politics from the 1950s-60s. However, there is one name that fails to appear in most of our history books but is indeed one of the most influential in Indian politics is Mr. V. K. Krishna Menon.  V. K. Krishna Menon was also known as the 'Hero of Kashmir'. He was a Diplomat and the Indian Representative in the UN for the tenure of 1952 to 1962.   And even though there have been very few mentions of his role in the course of our history, V.K. Krishna Menon, also known as "Nehru's Evil Genius", played a very vital role in creating a firm stand of India on the topic of Kashmir in the UN. V.K. Krishna Menon was born on 3rd May 1896 and held many roles, achievements, and accolades to his name. But there is one such instance which distinguishes this 'Hero of Kashmir' from others and also gives a person the clear picture of how assertive, intelligent, witty and outspoken Menon could have been. This instance is of the time when India and Pakistan were struggling to hold a strong foot in Kashmir. When the issue was raised in United Nations Security Council in 1957, V.K. Krishna Menon, who then was representing India spoke for 8 hours non stop. And yes, His speech till date holds the record of the longest speech to be delivered in the UN.   V.K. Krishna Menon spoke passionately about India's rights on the controversial state of Kashmir on the 23rd January. He completed his speech on the very next day.   Menon collapsed after delivering the first 5 hours of his speech after which he was hospitalized, but he insisted on returning. He delivered the next 2 hours 48 minutes of the speech with a doctor closely monitoring his vitals before finally completing and collapsing. The speech which runs in 160 pages can still be found on the official UN website. It clearly shows the amount of love V.K. Krishna Menon had for his country. The speech was so convincing that it led the UN Security Council to favor India on the state of Kashmir. It also helped Nehru move forward and get a temporary stronghold in the disputed part of Kashmir. And because of this very instance, V.K. Krishna Menon was named the 'Hero of Kashmir', implying the positive effects of his efforts towards confirming the state for India. Every one who knew Menon had varied impressions of him. Most of the Westerners didn't like his outspoken attitude where this one time on a British novelist's surprise on Menon's English, he replied saying, "My English is better than yours. You merely picked it up, I learnt it". On the other hand, Indian politicians of that time spoke very highly of Menon. And why not? Menon was also famous for not accepting any more than 1 rupee as a High Commissioner. Later, he refused to accept that amount too. Surely his contributions are not the most talked about in the wake of the rising tensions between India and Pakistan for Kashmir. However, they are certainly not forgotten and will remain etched in the history forever. Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 12 Mar, 8.12 am
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/kaumudiglobal-epaper-kglobal/rajesh+was+murdered+by+ex+husband+s+enemies+dance+teacher-newsid-85158795| Kerala Rajesh was murdered by ex-husband's enemies: Dance teacher |  DOHA: Dance teacher Safiya, who was close to former radio jockey and singer Rajesh from Madavoor in Kilimanoor, who was hacked to death, has come to the fore with crucial evidences.  She has revealed that her ex-husband Sattar did not give the quotation to murder Rajesh.  She has also said that she was close to Rajesh's family, and that she had financially helped Rajesh many times.  Talking to a private media in Qatar, she has also revealed that Rajesh was her last hope as she was abandoned by her husband and family, and that she wished to live with Rajesh sometime in the future.   Sattar cannot kill Rajesh   The two prime suspects in the case Abdul Sattar and Ali Bhai aka. Salih Bin Jalal were present in Doha on the day that Rajesh was murdered, she said.  "They two meet quite often but I don't think they would ever plan to kill Rajesh as they were aware that the police would automatically suspect them. Sattar would never dare to kill Rajesh who very systematically records everything. Besides, Sattar has many enemies and a third person who is an enemy is the reason why our family life has become like this. He is a very rich person and Sattar opened a gymnasium in partnership with him. But since the gym was opened in a place where common labourers live, it closed down soon. Maybe this third person is behind the murder," she said.  She further said that Sattar cannot harm such an innocent person like Rajesh. "Sattar is a good father. I've cried many times on seeing him putting our two daughters to sleep on his either sides. He is also a good son to his parents, and I don't think a person like him could murder Rajesh who leads a very simple life," she said.  Safiya further explained that she came to Qatar when she was 22 years old and it was Sattar who helped her when she faced problems with VISA. "Our friendship naturally grew into a love relationship, and we got married. We have two daughters," she said.  She added that Sattar has never tried to convert her religion.  'I wished to live with Rajesh'   "Rajesh is from a very simple family. He is a folk musician and he earns a pittance for a living. Also, he doesn't get programs on a daily basis. And because of this I used to help him as much as I could. Sometimes I send him Rs. 5,000, and Rs. 10,000 in other months. I've done whatever I could to help a family financially. This has been going on for the past eight months. I've send him the money to pay his son's fees. And do you think I would give a quotation to kill Rajesh whom I helped so much?" she said.  She also said that both Sattar and her family had abandoned her and Rajesh was her last resort.  "Though Rajesh had a family that did not concern me. We wished to live together some day," she said.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/india+to+grow+at+7+4+in+2018+imf-newsid-85933194| Business India to grow at 7.4% in 2018: IMF | India is expected to grow at 7.4% in 2018 and 7.8% in 2019, leaving its nearest rival China behind at 6.6% and 6.4%, respectively in the two years, the IMF said on Tuesday. With growth picking up after falling sharply in the second quarter of 2017 due to "one-off factors", India in 2018 and 2019 would re-emerge as one of the fastest growing major economies, it said. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) has projected India to grow at 7.4% in 2018 and 7.8% in 2019. China is expected to grow at 6.6% and 6.4% , respectively in the two years.  However, the latest IMF growth rate projection remains unchanged since the last one in October.  India's growth rate in 2016 was 7.1% as against China's 6.7%. Two major economic reforms - demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST) - resulted in a slight lower growth rate of 6.7% in 2017. China with 6.9% growth jumped marginally ahead of India in 2017. India's projected growth provide some offset to China's gradual slowdown, the IMF said. The latest forecast is unchanged, "with the short-term firming of growth driven by a recovery from the transitory effects of the currency exchange initiative and implementation of the national goods and services tax, and supported by strong private consumption growth," the WEO said. According to the IMF, India has made progress on structural reforms in the recent past, including through the implementation of the GST, which will help reduce internal barriers to trade, increase efficiency, and improve tax compliance. "While the medium-term growth outlook for India is strong, an important challenge is to enhance inclusiveness," the report said. India's high public debt and recent failure to achieve the budget's deficit target call for continued fiscal consolidation into the medium term to further strengthen fiscal policy credibility, the report said. The main priorities for lifting constraints on job creation and ensuring that the demographic dividend is not wasted are to ease labour market rigidities, reduce infrastructure bottlenecks, and improve educational outcomes, the IMF said. According to the WEO, growth in China and India last year was supported by resurgent net exports and strong private consumption, respectively, while investment growth slowed.

Showbiz, glamour and fame have many times taken over love and the numerous failed celeb relationships we read about, is a testimony to this statement.  And one such chapter from the book of Bollywood's failed relationships is that of our beloved Preity Zinta. Every time a new love knocked on her doors, Preity embraced it with all her faith, trust and love. Only to realise that destiny had something else or shall we say, someone else written for her. Let's take a look at the many men in Preity Zinta's life.     Even though we never received any kind of official confirmation from the couple, it was reported by many sections of the society that Preity Zinta and actor, model Marc Robinson were more than "just good friends". It was before she ventured into films that Preity met Marc for modelling assignments and sparks flew between the two. Just like their affair, their break-up too remained heavily speculated. Though we never really got the reason behind their split, Preity always spoke highly of Marc and how he had helped her in easing into the industry. Once she also went on to say that she had some fond memories of Marc and would like to keep it just that way.    Grapevine was abuzz with the news of Abhishek Bachchan and Preity Zinta's sparkling chemistry not just on sets but off the sets too. Their camaraderie in films like Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Jhoom Barabar Jhoom was noticed by many. However, when asked about the relationship, both Abhishek and Preity always said that they were the best of friends in the industry.     The Australian cricket star, Brett Lee, was once rumoured to have dated Preity Zinta for a brief period. Though Preity always denied the news, Brett was quite outspoken when it came to expressing his feelings for Preity openly. Time and again, Brett and Preity were seen enjoying secret dates in Mumbai. In interviews, Lee went on to say that he found Preity to be a really lovely girl and was someone whose work he totally loved.     Yuvraj Singh and Preity Zinta's camaraderie started giving fodder to the gossip mills ever since the duo came together during IPL. Yuvraj was the star batsmen of Preity's KXIP team. Pictures of them celebrating their wins and enjoying some quality time together started making headlines. However, both of them always denied the news of any such link-up. In fact, when the news of Yuvraj Singh broke out, Preity said:  "I am a private person. I am amazed when I see so much being written about my life, without being confirmed by me. It has stopped bothering me, but there are a few things which I have taken to heart. When I was linked with Yuvraj Singh and Brett Lee - I will never forget that. They are my brothers. And I have decided to personally visit Lee and Yuvi on Raksha Bandhan and tie rakhis to them."  "I am a private person. I am amazed when I see so much being written about my life, without being confirmed by me. It has stopped bothering me, but there are a few things which I have taken to heart. When I was linked with Yuvraj Singh and Brett Lee - I will never forget that. They are my brothers. And I have decided to personally visit Lee and Yuvi on Raksha Bandhan and tie rakhis to them."     Then came the man whom everyone though Preity was destined to be with. After a few years of being "just good friends", Preity made her relationship with the business tycoon, Ness Wadia, official. From gala events, gold matches, to the wedding of Abhishek and Aishwarya; the duo could be spotted everywhere together. Holding hands, posing for shutterbugs, occasional pecks on the cheek and some rare PDA kept the media on tenterhooks. And right when we were all thinking of a fairytale wedding for the couple, their "too-good-to-be-true" relationship hit rock bottom. In 2009, after having dated for over five years, Preity accused Ness of physical molestation and mental torture. The first alarming sign in their relationship came when Ness Wadia's mother, Maureen, said:  "I don't care even if Ness gets married to a zebra."  "I don't care even if Ness gets married to a zebra."  Reportedly, the couple parted ways in 2009 after Ness Wadia allegedly slapped her at a party. Owing to a few more unresolved differences, they headed for splitsville but never spoke about it publicly.    Things took an ugly turn for the couple when Preity filed a case of abuse and harassment against Ness in 2014. The news spread like wildfire and grabbed headlines for many days. In her complaint, Preity had alleged:  "For some time we have ended our relationship. Although we are the co-owners of our team 'Kings XI Punjab', but we are no longer in a relationship and only talk for professional reasons and work. During that time he tried to abuse me and used extremely derogatory language and tried to behave in a manner where I was put to shame in front of my colleagues, friends and family."  "For some time we have ended our relationship. Although we are the co-owners of our team 'Kings XI Punjab', but we are no longer in a relationship and only talk for professional reasons and work. During that time he tried to abuse me and used extremely derogatory language and tried to behave in a manner where I was put to shame in front of my colleagues, friends and family."  She also added that she had verbally warned him several times but was repeatedly been embarrassed by his continuing behaviour towards her, especially in public.  "I say that Ness Wadia has gone to the extent of threatening me with dire consequences and intimidating me by boasting of his political clout and connections. Mr Ness Wadia had intimidated me by saying that he could make me disappear as I was a nobody and only an actress and he's a powerful person. I say that I have been tried to be very normal and nice to him as I wanted peace in my life, but the recent afore-stated incident in Mumbai at the Wankhede stadium has left me shattered and fear for my life."  "I say that Ness Wadia has gone to the extent of threatening me with dire consequences and intimidating me by boasting of his political clout and connections. Mr Ness Wadia had intimidated me by saying that he could make me disappear as I was a nobody and only an actress and he's a powerful person. I say that I have been tried to be very normal and nice to him as I wanted peace in my life, but the recent afore-stated incident in Mumbai at the Wankhede stadium has left me shattered and fear for my life."  Ness Wadia filed a counter case Preity and the duo dragged each other to court.    While Preity was fighting the case against Ness, she had mentioned few of his friends as witnesses. As per many reports, Gene Goodenough was one of Ness' close friends who decided to stand by Preity Zinta during that trying phase. Gene works as the Senior Vice President of the US-based hydroelectric power company. Bitten in love many times, soon Preity and Gene decided to make their relationship official. Although the duo kept their marriage plans and venue a secret, media kept running stories on Preity's impending wedding with someone she referred to as a "happy space with a happy guy" from LA.

Relax! You are not alone in your battle with bulge. Our dear Bollywood stars too have faced their share of "weighty" issues in the past. So, worry not! If they can do it, so can also can do. Listed are 10 superstars of the B-Town film industry and their weight reduction regime to help you kick the fat and shed the extra kilos from your body.  1. Sonakshi Sinha  Sonakshi Sinha faced much backlash for her weight when she made her debut with ' Dabangg'. This superstar once weighed 94 kg and she took a challenge and reduced 30 kg which was not an easy for her. She gained that much weight due to lack of exercise, excess intake of junk foods, but during her whole weight loss journey, she controlled her craving for junk foods and took balanced diet.  2. Sonam Kapoor     'Miss Style Icon' of Bollywood, Sonam Kapoor, who is known for her fashion seance rather than her acting skills, was around 86 kg before she signed her first film, "Saawariya". Her weight gain was due to unhealthy diet she used to have. She reduced 35 kilos to get that subtle yet sensuous look in her film. Sonam is very strict with her diet. She follows a low-carb and high-protein diet which is divided into five small meals. She munches on dry fruits and drinks milkshakes if she feels her hunger rising.  3. Parineeti Chopra      Parineeti, made bollywood debut with"Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl" in 2011 but got reorganization with romantic drama "Ishaqzaade" in 2012. Parineeti herself admitted in media that she was 86 kg before joining the Bollywood. Like all other actress of Bollywood, she also followed a strict diet plan, regular exercise, meditation, yoga session and due to all this hard work, she shed her extra weight and finally achieved success on her journey of Fat to Fit.  4. Arjun Kapoor     Dis you believe our heartthrob Arjun Kapoor wasn't this fit and fab in his teens. Arjun weighed over 170 kilos before Bollywood's fittest celeb Salman Khan took him under his wings and the '2 States' star lost 68 kilos for that fit 'n' fab body. His diet is very rich in protein. He consumes a lot of egg whites, boiled or grilled chicken and fish. He likes his chapatis made with pearl millet. He is a meat lover. He eats pineapple and strawberries and prefers protein shakes.  5. Zareen Khan     Hot and Bold Bollywood actress Zareen Khan was criticised for her weight gain. The actress, who looks fit and fab now, used to be a chubby girl in her teens and pre-teens. At one point of time Zareen weighed 100 kilos! But when she decided to being a model she shed those extra kilos. And within a year, with right exercise and diet, she lost 43 kilograms. To lose weight, Zareen followed a high protein diet which includes a lot of fruits and vegetable. Other than this, she is obsessed with drinking a lot of water for a good detox.   6. Jackky Bhagnani     'Youngistaan' actor Jackky Bhagnani weighed 130 kilos before becoming an actor. He lost over 80 kgs with rigorous exercises and a strict diet plan which he followed for over two years.  7. Bhumi Pednekar     The "Dum Laga Ke Haisha" actress already weighed 72 kgs, when she got an offer for this movie. And for this, she had to put even more weight and weighed around 89 kgs at the time she made her debut. However, soon after the film, the actress managed to drop all the extra fat and looks super-fit now! Unlike other celebrities, she did not restrict herself from enjoying the food. All she did was to switch the unhealthy ones with healthy choices. She gave up on refined sugar, carbs and alcohol. Her mother made a diet chart for her which included simple homestyle food.  8. Alia Bhatt     The young star of Bollywood who made her debut as a lead actress in the movie, "Student of the Year", was not always as fit as she looks now. She almost lost 16 kg of weight in 3 months. She avoids junk food and rather prefers to have a vegetable rich diet.  9. Tanmay Bhatt     Tanmay Bhatt has made us laugh harder than we could handle. He lost 109 kgs by following Keto diet. The diet endorses increased intake of healthy fats along with some proteins. It is a low carb diet. It might sound weird but this actually works.  10. RJ Malishka     RJ Malishka who showed her other talents on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa understood the importance of being fit on the dance-based reality show. She lost heaps of weight by working hard and following healthy eating habits. Her diet is more raw and paleo in nature. Her diet includes amazing things like tuna fish, potato soup, green salad, boiled asparagus, broccoli, raw green banana sandwich, banana flower soup with dates, lotus stem with brown rice, aloe vera juice, red gram salad and scrambled eggs.

Ashish Vidyarthi? | At least two videos on YouTube showed actor Ashish Vidyarthi as the father of Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love Story's wink sensation Priya Varrier. But is it true? Absolutely not. Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/what+it+means+if+a+lizard+falls+on+you-newsid-71506616| Home What it means if a lizard falls on you? | Ideally, you scream at the top of your lungs and run for your life. It is only later that the gravity of the situation dawns on you and you feel creepy all over. For those of you who fear lizards, our sympathies. In fact, there are people who will not venture into a room if they see a lizard in it (raises hand in admission). Though they are harmless (I find that difficult to believe) household pests, they have a lot of bad press attached to them. Also, they make good subject for superstitions as well. Apparently, if the poor lizard happens to fall on you it's trying to tell you something (how about the lizard just lost its balance?). Did you know a lizard falling on certain body parts mean certain things? It only goes to show these reptiles are not very good with staying on the ceilings.  Heck, whatever a lizard does has some meaning!  Scouring through the database of all things weird this is what we came up with  #The study of falling of lizards is called Gauli shastra. According to this shastra, every movement of a lizard holds significance and there are not less than 65 places where the lizard will fall on the human body that would foretell good and bad omens. #If you happen to see two lizards mating it means you are going to meet an old friend, if you seem them quarrelling you will also pick fight with someone. #If you see a dead lizard while moving into a new house, it could mean bad luck and illness for your family. On the contrary, some people believe seeing a lizard in the new house means Goddess Lakshmi is visiting them. #The lizard must know on which side to fall: Lizard falling on your right arm means elevation in society or a sensual adventure ahead and on your left arm means you are going to lose money. It is considered auspicious if the lizard falls on the right body parts of man and left body parts in women. For both it means different things. #The most common one, in the north if a lizard falls on your head it means good luck and if it falls on your forehead it means you will have a disease while some say it brings wealth. In the south people believe that if a lizard falls on the head then it means ill luck and in some cases even death. For example there is a story that a lizard fell on Chief Minister Biju Patnaik, just before elections in 2009, and he came back to power.​ #The lizard on the right and left shoulders mean victory and peace and happiness respectively. #If the thing decides to take a tour of your body, well, it seems it is wishing you a long life. #It is difficult to term what noise a lizard makes- is it twittering, is it chirping, or is it clucking? Anyway, so what does it mean when you hear a lizard's call? I would say it's just conversing with its mates but then humans also have an explanation for that as well. In Malayalam movies at least, if a lizard calls when you are saying something then it means that you are telling the truth and that is bound to happen. #To wash off all the ill luck that comes from touching a lizard or it falling on a person, one needs to visit Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram, where one can touch the golden Lizard, the silver lizard along with the sun and moon images on the roof, behind the sanctum sanctorum. When one touches them it is believed to remove all ill-effects or doshas caused due to the falling of lizards in the past and in future.  While we do not endorse any of these and do not wish lizards to fall on you, there are actually mentions of the lizard and its calls and more on its significance in Hinduism, Vedas and South Indian holy scriptures.

In a live show conducted by 8:00 pm last evening by Mahaa TV, the actress made some shocking comments on casting couch. The host Murthy stated that Mahaa TV conducted a sting operation, in which many a famous director, prominent personal from a big production house in Tollywood, and a Dubai-based coordinator are named.    In presence of a panel, that included Sri Reddy and Kathi Mahesh, the channel revealed the name of the coordinator. It is the coordinators that aid the heroines in getting offers. It was clearly heard from WhatsApp voice messages that, he was demanding the actress to spend a night with him.   The channel refused to reveal the name of the director, as per the request of the woman. But they have given enough hints about the director, stating that he makes films on 'developing villages', and 'developing country'. Meanwhile, netizens opined that the director is none other than Koratala Siva. 'Srimanthudu' and 'Bharat Ane Nenu' are about developing villages and developing the country. It will be interesting to what extent this issue will go.  Dailyhunt	|Friday, 16 Mar, 3.13 pm2 weeks ago6 days ago23 hrs agoyesterdayyesterday

Not only can they (okay, us) go on to tell you about how wide a door opens, we also master at talking about how difficult a car is to get in and out of. While suicide doors probably offer the best entry and exit, it's the scissor doors that win on aesthetics. They open upwards, are generally found in sports cars, but their popularity among modified cars cannot be underestimated. We look at a few modified cars which feature scissor, butterfly, or gullwing doors. Chevrolet Beat   ( Source )  Even in its standard avatar the Beat looks sporty, it has a unique character, and appeals a lot to youngsters. In addition to all that, a set of scissor doors is sure to help the car look better.  Old Honda Accord     ( Source) While the Accord is almost a luxo-barge and doesn't really fall in the tuner's favourite list of cars, but with a decently powerful engine under the bonnet (especially the V6), the car can be one of the few JDM ways to travel ground fast. Complementing its fast pace are the modified car's looks. Apart from the bodykit there's a pair of scissor doors and a split open bonnet, too.     Maruti Suzuki Swift (last generation)      (   Right from the time it was launched, the Swift has managed to sit on the fine line between the family hatchback and a well handling fun to drive car. If you want your Swift to incline towards the latter, then a set a good looking alloys, a body kit, and of course, a pair of scissor doors won't hurt.  Maruti Suzuki Kizashi     ( Source) The Kizashi failed to turn into a market success, owing to the CBU pricing and the lack of brand value in the premium market that MSIL is now pushing for, via its Nexa dealerships and corresponding products. However, it was a brilliant product, that not just drove well but looked quite imposing, too. You can of course make it look even better with the inclusion of scissor doors, like Autopsyche did. The good part is that the car looks the same apart from the door conversion, adding to its sleeper character. Until you swing open the doors, that is. Old Hyundai i20     ( Source) The Hyundai i20 gave the premium hatchback segment a much needed push - one that continues to help the car achieve good sales figures. But apart from being a hatchback that cost as much as a saloon, the i20 brought premium features, and was a product that people really wanted to buy. This also gave way to a few customised versions of the i20, and how could scissor doors remain behind! Modified by Big Daddy Customs - the same people behind the Moon Rover - the custom i20 is from 2012, features a bodykit, HRS alloy wheels, and scissor doors. Hyundai Elantra     ( Source) While it fails to stand out in any particular aspect, the Hyundai Elantra is one of the nicest all-rounder cars in the segment. It looks great, both on the inside and outside, has an adequately powerful engine, and the ride isn't bad either. It isn't certainly honed enough to be an outright enthusiasts' car, but the looks can be tweaked to make it even more appealing. The particular example with scissor doors, a light blue wrap, a huge wing at the rear, and a custom bodykit managed to stand out.     Maruti 800      ( Source) A two-door Maruti 800 isn't uncommon, but one that has its doors opening upwards certainly is. With headlamps from a Hyundai Accent and taillamps sourced off a Polo, the custom 800 manages the small car look but with added presence. Black bumpers, red body colour, and a contrasting white roof work in unison to make the car noticeable. Honda Civic     ( Source) Unlike the Accord featured above, the Civic is proper tuner material. It looks fast even when standstill, it drives well, isn't too long or heavy, and has the JDM essence intact. Having said that, it's susceptible to overly large bodykits, wings that look out of place, and, as you guessed, scissor doors. Smoked taillamps and dual exhaust at the rear add to the look.     Mitsubishi Lancer      ( Source) And talking about tuners, how can the king of them all go unnoticed. The bodykitted Lancer gets custom wheels (distasteful), a big spoiler at the rear (not bad!), a bodykit (front and rear bumper, side skirts, and flared wheel arches), and scissor doors. Will they look better had the car lost the other paraphernalia? Most probably, yes, but that's the owner's choice. Tata Pixel     ( Source) If only Tata Motors could pull this one off. It is called the Pixel, and was showcased at the 2012 Auto Expo. It won't be wrong to say that if there's a futuristic car which needs to be on sale at the moment, the Pixel is it. Powered by a 1.2-litre engine (placed at the rear), the micro car had space for four, boasted a touchscreen-equipped futuristic dashboard and scissor doors. Coolest scissor door car on list? You bet!    Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 24 Jan, 10.11 pm3 weeks ago2 weeks ago2 days ago3 weeks ago5 days ago

But the actor did not shy away from making comments when it was necessary. On the same lines, he has taken to Twitter to express his disappointment on Telugu News Channels, hosts, and YouTube channels.   Indirectly reacting on the controversy caused by Sri Reddy, and the kind of debates the TV Channels, and YouTube channels are hosting, Nani said, 'few TV Channels and YouTube channels are maligning the film industry. Everyone has to remember that, Media plays an important role in shaping the future. Do remember that kids are watching. Stop it', his tweet meant'.    He took a dig particular at the hosts of the TV Channels, and YouTube Channels, who ask questions that possibly help them achieve their 'target' TRP ratings.   Meanwhile, the Twitteraties did not come only with positivity. Many condemned Nani's statements, asking the actor why he kept silent when a TDP MLC was making stark comments on Film Industry. While others pointed out what happened to Nani when Posani fired on AP CM Chandrababu Naidu. Any tweet from a celebrity is turning into a tipsy tweet.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Ashish Vidyarthi? | At least two videos on YouTube showed actor Ashish Vidyarthi as the father of Malayalam movie Oru Adaar Love Story's wink sensation Priya Varrier. But is it true? Absolutely not. Ashish Vidyarthi is in no way related to Priya Varrier and family. But it is shocking to see that not only the banner picture of these video misleads people stating Ashish Vidyarthi as Priya Varrier's father, but it also says the same thing inside the video.    Here is the information on Priya Varrier's family.  Priya was born on October 28 in 1999 at Punkunnam, Thrissur in Kerala. Her father Prakash Varrier is a Central excise Department employee and mother Preetha is a homemaker. She has a brother Prasiddh Varrier. Priya is currently pursuing B.Com from Vimala College in Thrissur. She first started as a model and took it up as a career along with studies in 2017. Her first appearance in a creative work was in 2018, when she appeared in the music video Nee Vaanam Naan Mazhai. Currently, she has got a big break with Oru Adaar Love, where she became the talk of the country following the release of the video clip of her winking. It can be noted that she was not selected as the female lead of the film, but her popularity brought in luck and now she is acting as the lead in Oru Adaar Love. This is about Priya and no Ashish Vidyarthi is not Priya's father.          Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 2.34 pma month ago2 months ago2 months ago7 days ago2 months ago
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/sportzwiki+english-epaper-sptwiken/ipl+2018+match+11+rcb+vs+rr+match+prediction-newsid-85765725| Home IPL 2018, Match 11, RCB vs RR - Match Prediction | Photo by: Vipin Pawar / IPL/ SPORTZPICS In the first match of the doubleheader on super Sunday, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) will be gearing up to play the Rajasthan Royals (RR). The 11th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is just a week old. However, we have already witnessed some highly-intense games. The youngsters have unleashed some magnificent performances. Those have outclassed the performances of the more experienced campaigners. Earlier, Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad have begun their campaign with consecutive victories, Mumbai Indians, and Delhi Daredevils locked horns against each other on Saturday as Delhi had the last laugh in another thriller of an encounter.  Meanwhile, on Saturday evening Kolkata Knight Riders played against Surnisers Hyderabad in which visitors sealed a convincingly five-wicket win. Kolkata began with a victory but brilliant innings by Sam Billings in the second encounter helped CSK chase down a mammoth total of 203. Both teams; Bangalore and Royals began with defeats but came back strongly in the second encounter to get their campaign back on track. Bangalore lost the first match against the Kolkata Knight Riders by four wickets. Some good batting performances by AB de Villiers and Mandeep Singh helped RCB score a more than competitive 176 on the board. Whereas, de Villiers smashed 44 of 23 deliveries, Mandeep scored a quickfire 37 of just 18 deliveries.  Photo Credit: IPL. Knight Riders began their chase in spectacular fashion as Sunil Narine struck a 17-ball half-century. It almost dashed the hopes of the RCB fans. In the end, it was some sensible batting by skipper Dinesh Karthik which ensured KKR reached the target in the penultimate over. Overall Bangalore will be happy with their batting performance. However, as the tournament progresses their bowlers have to up the ante and start performing far better. Rajasthan Royals, on the other hand, was blown away by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the first encounter. It was some brilliant bowling by Siddharth Kaul and Shakib Al Hasan which restricted Rajasthan to a below-par score of 125 in their allotted 20 overs. Explosive opener Shikhar Dhawan smashed a brilliant knock of an unbeaten 77 which helped SRH chase the total down with 26 deliveries to spare. They lost just a solitary wicket in the process.  Team Combinations -   Royal Challengers Bangalore  Following their impressive victory against the Kings XI Punjab, Bangalore is unlikely to tinker with their winning combination. It was a good all-round performance by the whole team which eventually handed them a victory in the previous encounter. McCullum was dismissed without bothering the scorers. However, given his power hitting abilities at the top of the order, he is expected to retain his place. The bowling line-up is also expected to remain the same as all the bowlers were successful yesterday.  Predicted XI: Brendon McCullum, Quinton de Kock (wk), Virat Kohli (c), AB de Villiers, Sarfaraz Khan, Mandeep Singh, Chris Woakes, Washington Sundar, Kulwant Khejroliya, Umesh Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal  Photo by: Faheem Hussain / IPL/ SPORTZPICS  Rajasthan Royals:  The Rajasthan XI is also expected to remain the same given the fact that Jofra Archer isn't fit yet. If he is fit, Ben Laughlin will make way for him. However, Laughlin bowled well in the previous encounter. The top order looks settled. However D'Arcy Short have to come good to maintain his place for the rest of the tournament.  Predicted XI: D'Arcy Short, Rahul Tripathi, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Jofra Archer/Ben Laughlin, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat  Match prediction:  With Ben Stokes being the X-factor and the match being played in a relatively small Chinnaswamy Stadium, I have a gut feeling that Rajasthan might return as the winners of the 11th match of the tournament.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/4+types+of+automatic+cars+cvt+amt+dct+torque+converter+who+should+buy+what-newsid-80708209| CarToq 4 types of automatic cars - CVT, AMT, DCT & Torque Converter: Who should buy what? | Automatics are becoming extremely popular in the Indian car market. The introduction of affordable automatic cars has surged the demand drastically and now there are many different automatic transmission options to choose from. We explain all four kinds of automatics available in affordable cars sold in India. and who should choose what. Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)  Who should buy it? People looking for high fuel efficiency and affordability.  The AMT has recently become widely popular in the Indian market, especially after the introduction of the transmission in affordable cars. They are also known as semi-automatic transmission. The AMT is a low-cost transmission which is based on the manual transmission itself with a few additional equipment. These transmissions share most of the hardware with manual transmission, hence the cost of the transmission is low. AMTs are the cheapest automatic transmission currently available in the market.  The clutch of such transmissions work automatically and are operated by a servo motor, making them automatics. AMTs can be offered with both petrol and diesel engine options and the cost difference between the manual variants are not much. The AMTs are highly fuel efficient (similar to the manual models) and also offers affordable maintenance cost. The AMTs are not only available with low-cost cars but high-end sporty cars like Abarth 595 also use AMTs. The only downside is the jerky gear changes. Affordable cars like Tata Nano to Renault Duster, all offer AMTs in the Indian market. Continous Variable Transmissions (CVT)  Who should buy? People looking for refined automatics  CVTs are one of the most refined automatic transmissions. The CVTs use steel pulleys and a belt that can generate infinite gear ratios. The CVTs do not have any gears and there are no any such gear changes but only the ratio change happens. This type of transmission is very quiet too and is widely used in the automatics scooters in India. However, CVTs can feel a bit elastic when you push the throttle all the way to create a rubberband effect. Affordable cars like Nissan Micra, Maruti Baleno use this type of transmission. CVTs can also get paddle shifters to give them a sporty look. In India, Honda cars like Jazz and City offer paddle shifters with their CVT. Dual Clutch Transmissions  Who should buy? People who want high-performance automatics  Dual Clutch Transmission is one of the most advanced transmissions available in the market. The dual clutch transmissions have twin clutch system that offers lightning-quick shifts. The two clutches take on the odd and even gear numbers separately while the gear system itself is similar to the manual transmission. There are two types of dual clutch transmissions - wet and dry. Depending on the torque of the engine dry or wet systems are used. Such transmissions are very quick to shift between the gears making them a common choice of high-end car manufacturers. Many affordable vehicles like VW Polo GT TSI, Ford Figo, VW Ameo, Skoda Rapid diesel etc are also available with the twin-clutch transmissions. Torque converters  Who should buy? People who do not have any other choice  The torque converters are the oldest kind of automatic transmissions that were once widely used in all the vehicles. Such transmission systems use planetary gear system with a turbine and impeller. There is a fluid present in the impeller that gets pushed due to the centrifugal forces and moves the turbine. Torque converters are quite outdated and are not as widely used as other types of transmissions. Torque converters also face lot transmission loss and low fuel efficiency. Cars like Tata Hexa and Mahindra XUV 500 use such transmission but they are much refined and improved. Torque converters have been around for a long time now and over the time, they have become quite reliable. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 29 Jan, 7.44 am6 days ago2 weeks ago2 days ago4 hrs ago2 weeks ago

Like the Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood – the Bengali film industry produce many good films. Like they are bold movies in every industry, the Bengali film industry has also produced many bold movies. Here, is a list of 5 Bengali movies that have crossed the limits of nudity and boldness. Chatrak (2001) This Bengali film, stars Anubrat Basu and Paoli Dam. The film was struck many controversies for the number of intimate frames. How do the makers of such films think that the movie can be watched with the family? Or maybe the maker doesn’t need people to watch the movie happily.   Cosmic Sex (2014) Having a storyline that revolves around s** and spirituality. The actresses of the film also won ‘best actress award at Osian’s Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema’. Bold one. But, good for nothing. It must be noted that the directors of such films can take some responsibility and avoid taking such films.  Khawto (2016) The romantic thriller stars Prosenjit Chatterjee, Paoli Dam and Raima sen. The plot of this story is the sexual relationship of novelist Nrbed Lahiri and the character of a women in his book. I don’t understand the moto of the director of such films. Seriously. Don’t they understand how vunerable the minds of little kids towards such obscene films.!  Chhip Suto Char The plot of the movie is the romantic drama that goes around four young girls.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news+karnataka-epaper-newskarn/it+will+not+be+easy+for+haris+in+2018-newsid-69620438| Top News It will not be easy for Haris in 2018! |  Bengaluru: Shanti Nagar Assembly segment is represented by Congress MLA N A Haris. It is known as a bastion of Congress. Since 1967, 11 elections were held to the State Assembly. Congress candidates romped home eight times. BJP candidate S Raghu got elected in 2004 while Janata Dal (Secular) candidate D G Hemavathy succeeded in defeating veteran Congress leader M Muniswamy in 1994. Congress candidates in 2004 and 1994 were defeated by a few hundred votes majority. Haris, the incumbent, got elected by a huge margin in the both the elections-20,205 in 2013 against K Vasudeva Murthy of JD (S) and 14,797 in 2008 against D U Mallikarjuna of BJP.  The total number of voters is 1,99,680. The number of male voters is 1,01,778 and women voters 97,8754 while 28 are others. According to political analysts and local residents, it may not be easy for the Congress candidate to sail through in the Assembly elections to be held in 2018. They attribute it to the success of BJP candidates in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). BJP candidates won from four wards out of seven wards in 2015. While one independent got elected from one ward, Congress succeeded in bagging only two wards-Neelasandra and Shanthinagar. Congress could not win from wards such as Jogupalya, Shanthalanagar, Agaram and Vannarpet where BJP candidates romped home while Domalur ward slipped away from BJP to an independent. "Developmental works have not been taken up since the last three years. For example, MLA Haris laid a foundation stone for a community hall three years ago but the construction is yet to commence,'' A Chandrasekhar, a resident of Shanthinagar working as an interior designer said. Haris played a key role in demolition of quarters constructed by the BBMP at Ejipura for economically weaker sections. The quarters were demolished in January 2013 by promising to construct new quarters for the residents but no work has taken place even after five years. "They promised to construct the houses for us while convincing us to vacate the quarters in 2013. Taking their assurance seriously, we have been residing on this footpath in a makeshift tent. We have to walk a few hundred metres even to attend nature's call since the public toilets are situated on the other side of the road,'' lamented a resident. Many people in Vinayakanagar are not happy with present MLA's apathetic attitude in evicting dyeing units which are posing danger to environment and also polluting drinking water. There are 24 dyeing units at Vinayakanagar causing much inconvenience to the residents. The residents allege the dyeing units are functioning with the blessings of elected representatives. "The MLA is not bothered about our health. He is interested in vote bank politics. We want him to help us by evicting dyeing units from this area. The drinking water is being polluted because of the units letting waste water into the drains,'' complains Pushapa N (name changed), a home-maker. The shopkeepers and vendors at Austin Town market also are not happy with the MLA's style of functioning. The BBMP proposed to demolish the existing market to make way for a new one but no initiative was taken in this regard. "Our MLA has become inaccessible. He visits our area once in a year to attend functions. He distributes rice and other gifts to selected people on his birthday. We want him to focus on developmental works,'' said a home-maker on condition of anonymity. Some of the residents at Neelasandra are yet to receive title deeds of their homes. They complain that MLA has been postponing issuing of title deeds on one or the other pretext. They also complain that MLA has not taken measures to mitigate civic problems at Neelasandra. They said many people fall sick often due to mosquitoes and unhygienic condition owing to an open storm water drain that is choked with silt and garbage. "We are not able to bear with the bad odour emanating from the nearby storm water drain. We are not lucky even to receive clean drinking water supplied by Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB). We want our MLA to do something to fix these problems,'' V Sara, a fast food vendor said. However, MLA NA Haris was not available for comment. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 29 Jun, 5.30 am

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Well, this one will simply blow your mind. The registration number 'F1' has gone on sale in the United Kingdom for, wait for it, a whopping Rs 132 crore! Yes, you can actually have the number 'F1' on your car in the UK, provided you are willing to pay such a stratospheric amount for it. The F1 number plate has been on many cars in the UK. These include a couple of Mercedes-McLaren SLR, a few custom Range Rover SUVs, and even a Bugatti Veyron. This plate got into private hands in the year 2008, before which it was under the ownership of the Essex City Council since the year 1904. Till now, the F1 plate has been used by one Afzal Kahn. Kahn is the owner of Kahn Design, a famous UK-based car customizer.  The F1 registration plate has remained in the limelight for the obvious reference to Formula 1, the most famous form of motorsports almost across the globe. Of course, another reason for its fame is the fact that there are only a few two-digit plates around the world. This plate first went on sale for Rs 4 Crore. Its current value, however, is pegged at a mind-blowing Rs 132 crore. If sold, it will even overshadow the D5 plate bought in Dubai for a staggering Rs 67 Crore by one Balwinder Sahani. The single-digit plate '1' was sold in Abu Dhabi for Rs 66 crore.    While such custom number plates aren't available in India, one can always purchase a special number plate from the RTO. There have been many instances of people buying really expensive plates for vehicles ranging from a Honda Activa (!) to the likes of Mercedes S-Class. Last month, it came to light that registration plates with special numbers, such as 8055 and 4141, which translate to 'BOSS' and 'PAPA (in Hindi numerals)' respectively, will soon become available for sale at a higher-than-normal price. Officials feel that charging for such numbers will help the RTO maximize its earnings. Images courtesy NDTV  Dailyhunt	|Monday, 09 Apr, 7.22 pm3 weeks agoa week ago

Well, in hopes of shedding a few kilos from our waist and few years from our age, rarely do we realise that it is our face that builds the first impression. So, what is the use of having that perfect figure if your face has wrinkles and sagging skin? But, fret not. Take a look at these facial exercises designed for the purpose of subtracting a few years from your face and keeping people in dilemma of your real age. #1. For your jawline     The platysma is the muscle that connects your jawline to your shoulders. Loosening of this muscle leads to the double chin and sagging skin on the neck. Here is an exercise to tone the neck, chin and jaw area.   Stand or sit straight, and tilt your head back as if to look at the ceiling. Hold your head still. Now touch your tongue to the roof of the mouth. You will feel a slight tingling pain in your neck because of the contraction of muscles. Now let go, and bring your chin down to your neck region. Repeat exercise in sets of five, holding your tongue for about 25-30 seconds. #2. Double chin reduction    A problem mainly faced by those who are on the heavier side can become a serious threat later on as they begin to loosen up. Try this exercise daily to shape up your chin and neck.   Keeping your posture upright and your neck erect and press your lower lip over your upper lip. Now, smile and lift the corners of your lips. After this, using your palms, rub the underlying muscle as vigorously for a few times. As soon as you start feeling the hint of strain on your lower neck region, stop.  #3. Facial yoga    This style of yoga helps to tone the muscles of your neck and face. It increases blood circulation and relieves tension in facial muscles. The key to face yoga is holding your breath in and then expelling air out in a manner which disciplines your face muscles. Stand straight and take a deep breath through your mouth. Puff your cheeks out, while holding the breath in. Hold as long as you can. After this, exhale through your nose. Repeat the procedure 8-10 times.  #4. Forehead repairing    Here is an exercise designed to reduce wrinkles on your forehead. This exercise will help you to find your way towards a smoother and ageless forehead.  This is one of the simplest exercises that you can do anytime and anywhere you want without getting any questioning looks. All you have to do is make a surprised expression. Yes, act surprise to smoothen out the lines from your forehead. Without wrinkling your forehead, widen your eyes as much as possible. Repeat this at least 8-10 times and do it twice a day to see a smoother forehead. #5. Flex your brows    Eyebrows loose density and lack firmness with age. Sagging eyebrows would make your face look pale and dull. Escape the fate of aged eyebrows with this exercise.   Use the tip of your fingers to hold your eyebrows from right below your brows. Now, put some pressure on your brows and lift them up and outwards with your eyes wide open. Hold this for at least 5-7 seconds. After this, use the muscles above your brow to press down against your fingers (again for 5 seconds). This will work well on the flexibility of your brows.  #6. Work those cheeks    This particular workout helps to firm your cheeks. This exercise also helps to eliminate pouches on your face and laugh lines near your mouth.  Separate your cheek muscles to the corner of your mouth using your fingers. Now, suck your cheeks in and lift your jaw. This will bring out the creases on either side of your face. After this, use both your middle fingers, placing them upon the creases to smoothen the skin. Repeat the movement for 15-20 times.  #7. Chew a gum    Chewing gums actually helps to fight signs of ageing. When done in moderation, chewing gums tend to provide a steady and consistent movement of facial muscles. This helps to keep the facial muscles toned and makes the surrounding skin much firmer. It also helps in the smoothening out skin.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+indian+economist-epaper-indecono/the+failure+of+make+in+india+in+the+defence+sector-newsid-79876781| Recent Articles The failure of Make in India in the defence sector |  By Arsh Rampal   A Times of India report has revealed that a major deal regarding minesweeper warships under Make in India has been cancelled by the Government. This is a major setback not only to the development of defence systems in the country but also to the Make in India campaign. The Modi government has as of yet failed to break a successful deal in the defence sector under Make in India and it can have a major impact upon the status and ability of the Indian military to defend the nation in the present circumstances as tensions continue to mount between India, China and Pakistan.   The Minesweeper Deal - 350   Mine counter-measure vessels (MCMVs) or Advanced minesweepers are around 900-tonne specialised warships that can detect, track and destroy underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and offshore installations, disrupt shipping and maritime trade. It combines the role of a minesweeper and minehunter in one hull. India had a deal with South Korea to build 12 advanced minesweepers. The project was estimated to start in 2018 with the delivery of the 12 minesweepers starting in 2021. The project was part of Prime Minister Modi's Make in India program and was worth ₹32,000 crores. The minesweepers were to be built at the Goa Shipyard. The entire process will start again with a fresh request for proposal (RFP) or tender will follow for that. The deal has reportedly broken off as the South Korean company wanted changes in the original RFP. There were also some ToT (transfer of technology), build strategy and cost problems. It is not the first time that Kangnam, the company with which the deal was made, has come under the scanner of the Indian government. The government has previously scrapped a similar contract with the company upon corruption allegations in 2014. The Indian navy needs nearly 24 minesweepers along its coastline to properly protect the Indian coastline. India lacks behind that number by a huge margin. The Indian Navy has recently decommissioned two of its oldest minesweepers, the INS Karwar and INS Kakinada after 30 years in service. The navy is now left with a fleet of four minesweeping ships.  Make In India a failure to date  Currently, to date, no major Make in India defence project has kicked off. The Modi government has failed to give the defence sector the push it needs. The defence projects under Make in India have failed to materialise due to lack of political push, bureaucratic bottlenecks and long procedures and differences between the government and the companies regarding technical details of the project. Apart from the MCMV project India's project with Russia to co-develop and coproduce an Indian variant of its Sukhoi T-50 fighter has also slowed down after the Indian Air Force raised doubts regarding its stealth capabilities, engine performance, high cost and delivery time-frame. The final production and R&D contract has not been finalised as of now. Several projects collectively worth over Rs. 3.5 lakh crore are stuck at different stages without the project materialising. Apart from MCMVs, future infantry combat vehicles (FICVs), light utility helicopters and Naval multi-role choppers along with fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA). The issue of logjams with regards to defence projects started when Manohar Parrikar was the Defence Minister and were inherited later by Arun Jaitley and now Nirmala Sitharaman.  Need for an upgrade in India's defences  India has continuously for the past few years been one of the highest importers of arms. India's arms import between 2012 and 2016 accounted for 13 percent of global arms imports. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has several times emphasised upon the need for reduction of arms imports to India. The Cabinet has repeatedly talked about the need for domestic defence manufacturing and that the Indian Military should have more local components in its military equipment. It is extremely crucial for India to focus on strengthening the military at a time when China is turning slightly aggressive. There have been multiple reports of sighting of Chinese ships being deployed in the Indian Ocean. In order to tackle the rising presence of Chinese Military in the area, it is important that the strength of the Indian Navy is not compromised upon however with the current failure of the MCMV deal, a huge blow has been dealt with the Indian Navy. The present 4 Soviet-built minesweepers with the Indian Navy are also to be decommissioned by the end of 2018 and thus India will be lacking a major defence tool to guard its coastline. The Air Force and the Army face similar issues and in a few years, India will lack the major equipment needed to defend itself with an increase in hostility. In order to meet the demand for newer equipment, the Modi Government needs to sign and bring into effect more defence deals. Even if these projects are to start immediately it will take at least 2 to 3 years for any production to take place of military equipment and thus it seems that India's military will be at a massive technological disadvantage for the next few years. The Modi government's keenness to improve India's military seems to be only on paper. The large strength of the Indian Military in itself cannot by itself be sufficient to defend the nation without proper technology at its disposal. The Modi Government needs to focus upon ensuring that defence deals under the Make in India project do not collapse, not just for the success of the Make in India scheme but for properly securing the nation as well. Until the time this is done by the government the security of the nation is likely to get jeopardized.

Our social narrative resonates with multiples cultures and practices and we are downright proud of that. To be a true Indian however, you need to mouth the profanities like a boss for fitting in. Turns out, using cuss words are not only college students but they are really stress-busting and helps vent your anger in a better way. What’s more ridiculous, we ask someone to teach us their swear words first to get a hang of their culture before we learn their language. This is the spirit of India and here we have assembled a number of cuss words from different languages of India that will make you go ROFL: Hindi: Behenchod- It means sister fucker. Since incest is equal to committing sin in our country, this gaali is a serious annoyer.   Assamese: Kela- Kela in Assamese is suggestive of dick. Kela means Banana in general which has resemblance to, well you know. Nagori Putek- Son of a bastard . These two words contain half the greeting.  Bengali: Khankir chele- Son of a whore. This gaali  will drive a Bengali nuts and we hear the bus drivers hurling it at each other in a busy traffic. Bokachoda- Stupid fucker. This is a landmark gaali in Bengali which we attempt at someone lovingly too sometimes. Bengalis are equally into profanity like intellectual debates on Art, culture and literature.  Gujarati: Bhosad Pappu: idiot with a pussy. Chodhru: Dumbass These two gaalis are staples in Gujarati language both in irritation and salutation.  Kannada: Dagaar: Bitch Nin Hendruna Kaiya: Dumbass. Dare tease them on the Telengana issue and you will be replied with these depending on your gender.  Marathi: Aai Ghalya: Motherfucker Tuja Aai la: To your mother or the proverbial ‘ Teri maa ki’ Remember how many times you have heard these profanities in films and television soaps?  Punjabi: Bund: Ass Kanjar: Gigolo Punjabis are kickass gaali- hurlers and their profanities hit others hard!  Malyalam: Kunna: Dick Chandi: Ass Looks like Malayali people are obsessed with human anatomy!  Kashmiri: Gaen: Prostitute Momri Kalle: Dickhead Let’s not spark controversies by cracking a joke on these! Lips zipped!  Telugu: Gudda: asshole Dengu: Fuck Did it change your perspective for the childhood games? We guess yes!

The biggest show in the WWE industry has always caught the imagination of the wrestling fanatics, and the just-concluded 34th edition also lived up to its billing. Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey making her in-ring debut was probably the show-stopper. She teamed up Kurt Angle to defeat Stephanie McMahon and Triple H in a thrilling bout. At the same time, some can say the main attraction of the night was the much-anticipated fight between Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar defeated a bloodied Reigns to retain his Universal Championship Match. The event also saw the return of The Undertaker, as he made a winning comeback by thrashing John Cena.  In another notable fight, SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair ended the unbeaten streak of Asuka in one of the best women's matches in WrestleMania history. It is safe to say that the crowd thoroughly enjoyed the event.  A bloodied Reigns lost to Lesnar But amidst all this, something unfortunate happened. WWE star Natalya suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction during the event. After being thrown out of the rind during women's Battle Royal, she fell on the floor in an uncompromising position. The cameras were quick to point out the part which was visible, much to the embarrassment of Natalya.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/careguru+english-epaper-creguru/does+your+palm+have+a+trident+sign+know+what+it+means-newsid-77898474| Lifestyle Does Your Palm Have A Trident Sign? Know What It Means |   Even though they are not exactly correct, markings on your palm are prominent amongst almost all humans. Matching to the Vedic blood measurements, the lines on the palm give answers about a person's personality and these also help uncover a person's real and best feature.   So, if you find a trident or a trishul on your palm, it means could signify something good. The trishul showing is not found in everybody's palm and those who have this showing in certain positions of their palm are said to be the blessed few, as these keep their own significance. The tridents can maintain either an upward or down direction. It is assumed that the upward facing trident gives a unique perspective and energy, while the lower facing trident is less effective.        Trident on sun: This trident present on the mount of sunlight is equivalent to the star formation on the palm. Presence of this sign/symbol indicates that the person is understood, rich, successful and wealthy career-wise.   If the trident appears on the support of Saturn, it is a fantastic mark of knowledge and materialistic wealth. Those who have this trident are said to become rich and successful in their career due to their hard work and struggle.   Trident on Jupiter: This kind of trident's occurrence is a spectacular mark of success and recognition. The people are packed with ambition and they want to lead and manage people around them. These marks are usually found in frontrunners.   Trident on Mercury: In the event the trident is present on the support of Mercury, it makes the person wealthy. They can see a rise in the position at the job entry and increase in responsibility due to one's business and communication skills. Individuals who have this sign capture attention in a huge crowd and the popularity increases, all because of their magnetic speeches and toasts and charming personality.        Trident on Saturn: Trident present at the end of the heart line is considered to be a really fortuitous sign, particularly if it might end under the mount of Jupiter as shown in the picture.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news24online-epaper-newsonline/top+5+controversies+of+ms+dhoni-newsid-75265024| Sports Top 5 controversies of MS Dhoni! |  New Delhi, Oct 25: Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni proved to be as one of the finest Indian cricket team captain. He is always on the go whether it is on the field or off it. During his span of Indian cricket team captain, Dhoni has made some controversial statement which created major ripples in the cricket team. After holding several press conferences, even the best may make a few mistakes.   So here we present the top 5 statements that landed one of the BEST captain in trouble.      1) Lack of technique for Tests Matches: Dhoni had once commented just before the start of the crucial Australian tour that, "I do not have the technique to play Test Cricket." The statement raised many eyebrows in the cricket fraternity all over the world. Dhoni was never known for his batting technique but public acknowledgement of the same and that too just before the start of a vital test match, allegedly did not go down well with many in Indian cricket fraternity.      2) Forgetting Yusuf Pathan's name: It is widely known fact that MS Dhoni allegedly did not have much faith in the capabilities of Yusuf Pathan and problems only grew stronger after the former Indian skipper forgot his name just before the start of an ODI in South Africa. The incident happened like this: Just after the toss, Dhoni said, "Piyush, and I can not remember the fourth guy who is not playing."      3) Retirement from Test Cricket: During the Border-Gavaskar Series, MS Dhoni created ripples when he made this statement, "I don't think my body will allow me to play Tests post 2013 because I will have to see will I play the 2015 World Cup." There would have been no problem at all had this statement came at another time but making it just in the middle of vital Test Match series shocked many in the Indian cricket team.      4) Display of strength: This one wasn't a consequence of Dhoni's controversial statement but his actions instead. The entire Indian team walked into the press conference room during the World T20 in England in 2009. They posed for the camera - driving home the point that there was no rift in the team. While that might have been the case, what angered the media so much was the fact that the captain refused to address the press ahead of a crucial match.     5) Seniors are slow: The last statement can be termed as the biggest of all controversies Dhoni made. It sparked major debates in the Indian Cricket team. The statement of MS Dhoni was widely debated on TV Channels all across the world. Dhoni said about the senior players Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, "They are safe fielders but on the slower side, they can end up getting injured in big Australian grounds."  This comment landed MS Dhoni into the biggest controversy of his career. It also angered many in the Indian cricket team. While there is no doubting the fact that the skipper was well within his rights to say that, the problem arose when he raised fingers at two legends of Indian cricket Tendulkar and Sehwag.

The unfortunate incident took a whole new dimension after photographs of a group of men on Monday spreading a beware sign at the Istanbul Airport. The pictures of Istanbul citizens sporting a white T-shirt with quotes displayed behind caution women visitors in India generated a lot of buzz on social media platforms and messaging application WhatsApp. The quotes: are:   "Beware in sending your females to India, #JusticeforAsifa," said one.    Another message says, "Women are not worthy as cows in India, #JusticeforAsifa."    "Women! Let India be your last country to visit, as it's your graveyard. #JusticeforAsifa," read the other one.  However, people on social media pointing out the pictures that went viral seem photoshopped.  The eight-year-old victim, who belonged to Bakerwal Muslim community was abducted on January 10 and held captive inside a temple in Rasana village of Hiranagar area. Her attackers, which included temple official and policemen, drugged and raped repeatedly before being murdered. Her body was found dumped in the adjoining forest area on January 17. The family had trouble even burying the body as some locals disallowed burial accusing the family of trying to occupy land in the name of a graveyard. Father of the victim has told the media the body was finally buried in far away forest lands. The chargesheet has revealed gory details about the crime and this has led to a public outcry in various parts of the country. All eight accused including Sanji Ram, a former revenue official and the alleged mastermind of the heinous crime were presented on Monday before Kathua Chief Judicial Magistrate A.S. Langeh amid tight security as the trial began. The trial court will hear the matter on April 28. Dailyhunt	|Tuesday, 17 Apr, 4.43 pma week ago4 days ago3 months ago2 months ago2 days ago

The girl, who was seen in the 1.7-minute-long video, is believed to be a resident of Bhadrak district. It appears that the male partner has shot their intimate moments, in the know of the girl. So far, no complaint has been registered with police in this regard. The incident will surely give fresh headache to the cops as the police are still investigating similar cases including the sensational case involving a youth and a girl from Chandbali in Bhadrak district. The youth had allegedly uploaded hundreds of sex videos to various pornographic websites.  Few days later, the youth was found dead on the banks of Kuakhai river here. Concerned over the situation, Odisha police had earlier issued advisory to all the district SPs and public to check circulation of such videos on the internet. "An advisory has been given to all the district SPs and police officers to follow a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with cases right from examining the objectionable images and videos that are going viral on social media platforms till filing the cases," DGP RP Sharma had told after inaugurating a cyber forensic division on the premises of the State Forensic Laboratory here in November last year.

Nothing is worse than finding an unexpected visitor of the bug variety in your home. Whether it be ants, spiders, or some type of rodent, no one enjoys finding a pest in their home. Although most are harmless, some surprising creatures can be potentially harmful to your health. You should definitely call an exterminator if you find this slimy creature in or around your home, and you won't believe what this terrifying worm can do in slide #6! Even the cleanest of households see their fair share of bugs within the home (shoes off at the door everyone!), and no matter how hard you try they find their way inside. All it takes is a few crumbs or an open door.   A few ants or a small spider isn't much to worry about, but if you find this creature somewhere in your home or yard you should definitely consider getting it taken care of!  This invasive little worm made its way to America through international trade, and this is not good news for the snail and slug species they prey on. This worm has no predators of its own because it tastes so awful, and this gives this species a good chance of spreading fast.  The New Guinea flatworm has been spotted in some gardens in Miami, and they typically survive in potted plants which gardeners move from one spot to another. Although their main prerogative is the consumption of snails, these slimy creatures pose a threat to larger creatures as well.  The New Guinea flatworm is even known to feast on mice and rats, and these animals can contract lungworm infections. This poses a problem for humans anywhere in the vicinity of these animals.  If humans come in contact with the air particles around an infected rodent's droppings, they can also contract an infection. This makes these disgusting creatures even more frightening.  The vomit of a New Guinea flatworm can harm human skin, so it's important to never go near or dare to touch one of these harmful worms. Their vomit contains a toxin dangerous to humans, and it's one more reason to steer clear.  This terrifying species has not been spotted outside the sunshine state, so be on alert if you plan on visiting Florida anytime soon. Share this with your friends and family down South so they know to be cautious when gardening or doing any activities outside. Better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to this worm.

Tataka's father Suketu was a Yaksha king who performed Tapas to please Lord Brahma so as to obtain an offspring. Suketu desired a son, but Brahma blessed him with a daughter, beautiful and strong in physique. She was Tataka who married Sunda. She had two sons Maricha and Subahu and a daughter, Kaikasi.Tataka and Sunda planned to marry off Kaikasi to the Rishi Visravas in order to obtain a progeny that would be all-powerful. Visravas, although already married, fell in love with Kaikasi and married her. Their son was Ravana, the mighty King of Lanka. Once, Rishi Agastya cursed Tataka's father Suketu to death. Tataka decided to wreak vengeance on the sage. She had the help of her son, Subahu. This enraged Agastya and he cursed Tataka to lose her beautiful physique, and transform into a demonic creature with a cruel and cannibalistic nature. The curse transformed Tataka into a man-eater with an ugly and fierce figure. After the curse of Agastya, Tataka started living in a place near the habitations of Malaja and Karusha in a forest near the river Ganga, opposite to the confluence of the river Sarayu. The area came to be known as the forest of Tataka. She terrorized the people, devouring anyone who dared to set foot in that forest.   Tataka and Subahu harassed many Rishis by destroying their Yagas with rains of flesh and blood. Maharshi Visvamitra was the most affected victim of Tataka's harassment. At last, Visvamitra approached Dasaratha, the King of Kosala, for help. The King obliged by sending two of his four sons, young Rama and Lakshmana, to the forest, entrusting them to protect both Visvamitra and his sacrifice.Visvamitra and the two princes Sree Ram and Lakshmana came to Tataka's forest and the sage ordered Lord Rama to kill the demoness to free the area from her terror. Rama was hesitant to kill her as she was a woman. He chopped off her hands so that she could not attack anyone further. Using her demonic powers, she changed her form, disappeared and continued her attack. Visvamitra advised Lord Ram that though a woman, Tataka was terrorising the region and as a prince, it was Sri Rama's duty to protect the people by killing the terrorists who plagued his people. Rama was thus convinced of killing Tataka. He pierced her heart with his arrows. Dailyhunt	|Wednesday, 11 Oct, 4.19 am

After Anajanmurthy's aides burnt tyres and shouted slogans against Rahul Gandhi on the highway near Nelmangala, supporters of party leader Ravikumar have vandalised the party office in Mandya district. Supporters of some other disgruntled ticket aspirants damaged party's offices in Chikmaglur, Bengaluru and Bellary. Another rebuffed party leader Brajesh Kalappa expressed displeasure on Facebook.Stay tuned for LIVE updates:  Apr 16, 2018 4:56 pm (IST)  By not giving tickets to Christians or Muslims, the BJP seems to be repeating its Uttar Pradesh strategy. Like UP, Karnataka has a numerically-significant Muslim population, but the BJP has not deemed it fit to name a single candidate from the community so far. The party had faced flak in UP too, but defended its stance, by saying that it must look at winnability. "I want to make an appeal to all Muslim brothers and sisters that they should join us. We will not allow hatred to prosper," Rajnath Singh had said.   Apr 16, 2018 4:38 pm (IST) Another Reddy clan member Sanna Fakerappa has also got a ticket. The BJP has not named any Christian or Muslim as a candidate so far.   Apr 16, 2018 4:37 pm (IST) Earlier, there was speculation that Somashekar may not get a ticket as BJP wants to stay away from those with a tainted past. Somashekar had placed all his trust in the statement of State BJP president BS Yeddyurappa during his Parivartan Yatra asking people to ensure his victory with a huge margin. He had already undertaken rigorous door-to-door campaign in the city.  Apr 16, 2018 4:33 pm (IST) Somashekar Reddy, the elder brother of mining baron G Janardhan Reddy, faces the charge of trying to bribe a Judge of a Special CBI Court to get bail for Janardhan Reddy. Somashekar, it may be mentioned here, won from the Ballari (city) constituency in the 2008 elections with a slender margin of 1,022 votes against Congress candidate Anil Lad. He did not contest the 2013 elections.  Apr 16, 2018 4:31 pm (IST) The second BJP list has an unmissable Yeddyurappa stamp, with several of his loyalists getting tickets. There are also several with tainted pasts in the BJP list. Among those is elder Reddy brother, G Somashekar Reddy, who will contest from Bellary city. Another tainted member is Katta Subramanya Naidu who was sent to jail after he and son were caught red handed by Lokayukta. He will contest from Shivajinagar. Krishnaiah Shetty who went to jail with BSY in Denotification scam has got a ticket from Malur. MP Renukacharya of sleaze gate past has got a ticket from Honnali.  Apr 16, 2018 4:24 pm (IST) The BJP, however, has still not announced who will face off against CM Siddaramaiah in Chamundeshwari or his son in Varuna constituency. The BJP had earlier announced candidates for 72 seats and a final list is still awaited.   Apr 16, 2018 4:20 pm (IST) BJP releases second list of 82 candidates for Karnataka Assembly polls, a day after Congress released its list of 218 candidates.  Apr 16, 2018 2:30 pm (IST) The dissident Congress workers in Karntaka's Mandya, Chikmaglur, Bengaluru and Bellary vandalised Congress offices for denying ticket to Ravikumar. Congress has given ticket to sitting MLA, actor Ambarish from Mandya. Ravikumar, who was also ticket aspirant, did not get the ticket. The supporters of Ravikumar went on street in Mandya condemning the move. They attacked Congress office and smashed the chairs and doors. They demanded to change the list and give ticket to Ravikumar from Mandya.  Apr 16, 2018 2:27 pm (IST)  Apr 16, 2018 1:55 pm (IST) Welcoming Owaisi's support, JDS' Kumaraswamy said, "Owaisi gave a befitting replying to Congress leaders who have been making allegations against JDS." The JDS state chief was mentioning Owaisi's statement where he said that both Congress and BJP have failed and have nothing to offer to Karnataka. Kumaraswamy further said, "It is possible that Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, who met us last week, may have persuaded Owaisi to support us."​  Apr 16, 2018 1:27 pm (IST) Congress leader and ex MLA, Prasannakumar, likely to join JDS. He is from Bengaluru city. KPCC vice president V R Sudarshan is upset over not getting party ticket from Kolar. He may join BJP.  Apr 16, 2018 1:26 pm (IST) A few MLAs, who did not get ticket, are meeting Mallikarjun Kharge. The former railways minister is reportedly upset that Siddaramaiah has got lion's share. Meanwhile, power minister D K Shivakumar says JDS and BJP have an agreement to defeat Siddaramaiah in Chamundeshwari and the pact was sealed three months ago.  Apr 16, 2018 1:22 pm (IST) The income tax department raided the residence of Congress MLA B Shivanna at the behest of Election Commission. Income tax officials said that since EC does not have powers to enter candidates' homes, the Commisson alerted IT that considerable cash was stashed at Shivanna's home. The IT officials then raided Shivanna's home at 5.30 am. They completed the raid at 9.30 am, but did not recover anything.  Apr 16, 2018 12:01 pm (IST) In the last three months, the Karnataka government was asked to spend as much as Rs 56 crore to glorify the achievements of chief minister Siddaramaiah ahead of state assembly elections. An RTI reply shows that the government used hoardings of its Department of Information and Publicity and other billboards on buses and auto-rickshaws, metro rail pillars, bus shelters of the BBMP, LED mobile vans and LED hoardings. Besides, video ads put out on social media, websites and TV channels are accounted for separately.  Apr 16, 2018 11:54 am (IST)  Apr 16, 2018 11:35 am (IST) MIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi said that he spoke to JD(S) chief H D Kumaraswamy and has decided that he will support former PM HD Deve Gowda's party. "It is in the interest of Karnataka and the nation that he (Kumaraswamy) becomes the CM. Congress is not powerful enough to stop BJP," he said. According to JDS sources, Owaisi had even approached Deve Gowda earlier for seat sharing arrangements, which was turned down by the former Prime Minister.  Apr 16, 2018 11:19 am (IST) Contrary to expectations, Siddaramaiah has only kept one seat for himself. There were rumors that he wanted to play it safe and contest from two seats. The Karnataka CM will now contest from only Chamundeshwari Assembly seat  People of north Karnataka had requested me to contest from Badami. I am grateful for their love & affection, but I have decided to contest only from ChamundeshwariCongratulations to candidates nominated to contest the Elections on a Congress ticket.Let us bring Congress back!— Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) April 16, 2018   Apr 16, 2018 11:05 am (IST) Congress ticket aspirant Anajanmurthy's followers stage a protest near Nelmangala after he was denied ticket. The protesters burn tyres on the highway. Meanwhile, another aspirant, Kalappa, has retweeted a post which says he should have been given ticket. The is believed to be upset with the Congress leadership.  Apr 16, 2018 10:21 am (IST)  Apr 16, 2018 10:00 am (IST) With an eye on Karnataka Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a five-day visit to Sweden and United Kindgom, will pay tributes at the statue of 12th-century Lingayat philosopher, Basaveshwara, on the banks of River Thames. He will also take part in the 885th Basava Utsava in London. Neeraj Patil, a former mayor of Lambeth Borough in London has confirmed PM's participation on April 18. Political experts say that the move will have political significance in light of the ongoing Lingayat issue.  Apr 16, 2018 9:52 am (IST) Congress president Rahul Gandhi is set to tour Karnataka on April 26, 27 and from May 3 to 10. The rally on May 10 will be organised on a large scale in Belgaum. Gandhi has completed six rounds of campaigning in the state with the last one on April 7 and 8. Polling will be held in Karnataka on May 12.   Apr 15, 2018 10:55 pm (IST) The BJP's central election committee (CEC), which comprises Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, met today to finalise the party's candidates for the May 12 Karnataka assembly polls. The BJP had declared its first list of 72 candidates on April 8. The party's top brass is believed to have discussed probables for the remainder seats in the 224-member assembly. Sources said names of more BJP candidates are likely to be announced in a day or two. The BJP is seeking to come back to power in the state, dislodging the Congress. H D Deve Gowda-led JD(S) is the third major player in the contest. The results of the election will be declared on May 15.  Apr 15, 2018 9:58 pm (IST) NA Haris, the MLA from Shanthinagar, has rushed to meet CM Siddaramaiah after his name was not featured in the list of 2018 candidates. The Congress will announce the names for 5 constituencies later. His son Mohammed Haris Nalapad brutal assault of a man at a prominent Bengaluru café seems to have cost him dear. Party insiders said that Congress is worried that even if Haris is able to win his seat, they may lose out on four or five other seats in Bengaluru purely because of the reputation he has acquired.  Apr 15, 2018 9:55 pm (IST) Former excise minister HY Meti, who was embroiled in a sex scandal that had cost him a cabinet berth, has got a ticket from Bagalkote. Party top brass says that winnability is the only criteria. A CD of the former minister had surfaced in the media in December 2016, in which he was allegedly seen having sex with a woman. Meti had quit after the local media went to town with the CD allegedly featuring him and a government employee, Vijayalakshmi. The woman had initially accused Meti of seeking sexual favours from her for a transfer and for her contract to be made permanent. Meti was given a clean chit by the CID last year.  Apr 15, 2018 9:26 pm (IST) CM Siddaramaiah seems to have an upper hand in the list as many of his supporters have gotten seats. In Hyderabad-Karnataka region, Mallikarjun Kharge has got seats for some of his people. The party has given seats to about 40 Lingayats and around 23 Vokkaligas. OBCs have been given roughly 50 seats while Brahmins have got 5. Smaller upper castes like Vaishyas, Bunts, Kodavas etc have got 1-3 seats each.  Apr 15, 2018 9:07 pm (IST) The Congress has also not announced any candidate from Melukote yet. There is a possibility that the party will support Swaraj India candidate Darshan Puttanaiah, the son of farmer activist Puttanaiah, who had died two months ago. Bengaluru mayor Sampath Raj will contest from CV Raman Nagar constituency.  Apr 15, 2018 9:04 pm (IST) Of the five constituencies from where Congress has not yet announced candidates for is Shanthinagar, the seat of NA Haris, who got embroiled in a controversy after his son Mohammed Haris Nalapad brutally assaulted a man at a prominent Bengaluru café. Party insiders said that Congress is sure of a victory here as it is a minority dominated constituency. However, they are worried that even if Haris is able to win this seat, they may lose out on four or five other seats in Bengaluru purely because of the reputation. So, not giving a ticket to Haris may help in other city segments. With 28 seats, Bangalore Urban is the single biggest chunk and is crucial for Congress.  Apr 15, 2018 8:58 pm (IST) Among the battles that will be keenly watched will be between former Mayor Padmavathi, who will contest against BJP veteran Suresh Kumar. Congress had always fielded Manjula Naidu against him till now and lost every time. Padmavathi is a loyalist of DK Shivakumar and had got a good reputation as a Mayor. Her term had ended in mid-2017.  Apr 15, 2018 8:54 pm (IST) Siddaramaiah's son Yatheendra has got a ticket from Varuna constituency while home minister Ramalinga Reddy's daughter Soumya has got a ticket from Jayanagar.  Apr 15, 2018 8:47 pm (IST) Contrary to expectation that Siddaramaiah will play safe and contest from two seats, he will only contest from Chamundeswari, at least if the first list is anything to go by. The Congress is yet to release names for five seats. Speculation was rife that Siddaramaiah is likely to keep a safe seat in north Karnataka region as a back-up after being convinced by his well-wishers about the dangers of relying only on the Chamundeshwari seat in view of a "deal" between JDS and the BJP there.

Lebanese-American former porn star had super-imposed a picture of her face onto the body of the Virgin Mary and wrote, "When a news outlet mistakes Malala for Mia Khalifa".  Earlier, a photo of ​Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai went viral on social media, and many mistook the image of Malala for Mia. According to various foreign media, a few months ago Mia Khalifa, 24, says people have sent her messages online threatening to behead her and also spoken that it was from alleged ISIS members.  She also said that the terrorist group had sent her some horrible images using social media.     In a recent radio interview with, The Sports Junkies, Mia says the bloodthirsty terrorist group sent her the gruesome images using social media. And Mai replied them saying, 'You can't show weakness. That's exactly what they're looking for. I really try and just make it look like it rolls off, but I'll admit, it gets to you after a while.'    Mia Khalifa added, "They photoshopped a picture of me being beheaded and threatened that that would happen to me."  Mia once sparked controversy in Lebanon and throughout the middle east with videos showing her having sex while wearing a hijab, part of traditional female Muslim dress.  Mia was born in a Muslim household, but she converted to Christianity. Later, she moved from Beirut, Lebanon, to the USA at the age of 10 before moving to Miami, where she's currently based. Mia considers Kim Kardashian and Sofia Vergara as her role models.     In 2012, Khalifa came under fire for her tattoos relating to Lebanon, including the opening line from the Lebanese national anthem and another of the Lebanese Forces Cross. Authorities accused Khalifa of shaming Lebanon by appearing in adult movies with these tattoos on her body. Despite only working in the entertainment industry for a short time, Khalifa is one of the most searched-for actresses on Pornhub.com. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 23 Oct, 3.16 pm
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/yourstory-epaper-yourstory/learning+from+a+failure+the+making+of+swiggy-newsid-85834315| Home Learning from a failure: the making of Swiggy | Every entrepreneur's journey is different with their own share of highs and lows, but what binds each one of them is the passion to commit, and the 'never-say-no' attitude. We at Accel are proud to have associated with such go-getters, whose journeys are motivating life lessons for many new and upcoming entrepreneurs. Here, we share one such inspirational founder's story.  You can also listen to the full podcast here.  "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I - I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference."  - Robert Frost  Started in August 2014, food ordering and delivery startup Swiggy today has more than 5,000,000 mobile application installations, and has become the household name for anyone and everyone who wants to order-in food.  Tying up with more than 25,000 restaurant owners, Swiggy has its own fleet of local delivery boys with operations across 13 cities in India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and more. While their story today looks impressive, the founder's success wasn't achieved overnight, and there were a few roadblocks on the way.  Formative years  Coming from a background of entrepreneurs, Sriharsha (Harsha) Majety, founder and CEO of Swiggy says, "Entrepreneurship was always in my blood. My father runs a restaurant in Vijayawada, and plans to invest in the hospitality sector and my mother is a doctor by profession and has her own clinic. She is also planning to start her own chain of beauty parlours. Seeing my family members being in charge, and taking control of what they do was an inspiration from early years." says Harsha. He also credits his journey to pursuing an Engineering degree at BITS Pilani, where he got an opportunity to meet people from different background and cultures. "I think those were my formative years. Unlike other colleges, Pilani never forced students with attendance, which gave us a lot of time to pursue our passions. I met a lot of people and dabbled in a lot of passions like quizzing, photography and travel." Being a travel buff, Harsha went on a lot of backpacking trips across South-East Asia and Europe. His traveling pursuits taught him a lesson or two about the world, which has also helped in his entrepreneurial journey. In one of his backpacking trips, Harsha realised how to tackle failures and unpreparedness with calmness and patience. "I went on a bicycle trip across Portugal and was not at all prepared for the weather conditions. I was exhausted, stranded and on the verge of giving up on the trip. I was helped by my holiday host, who took me in and helped instil the confidence to continue the journey. I was under a lot of pressure and he just told me that if I can't cycle uphill then I should hitch a ride uphill, and cycle only downhill. Which made a lot of sense then. He also made me understand that it was okay to pause and take a break and think about the long-term goal and not the short-term failures." These incidents have shaped Harsha, and even today he thinks that the issues of short-term can be resolved by not trying to put too much pressure and thinking about the long-term goals. "I think I have tried to apply the Zen approach in life to the extent possible and this has been immensely helpful in gaining some composure. That whole trip was about three months of cycling which was about 4,000 km by myself from Portugal to Turkey."  Being an entrepreneur  According to Harsha, one personality trait that has shaped him as an entrepreneur is stubbornness. "I was really stubborn about doing things that excited me and was ready to commit myself to it," he says. This is one of the reasons why he chose to give up campus placements and took a one-year gap before joining IIM-Calcutta. The traveller in him got excited on an opportunity to work as a trader at an investment bank in London. "London was exciting, but the job wasn't and halfway through the year I figured out that I needed to find more exciting things to do with my life so I took the hard decision of leaving London, and choosing to come back to India with no plan in mind. But I was sure of one thing - that whatever I was going to do in India was a long and hard commitment," says Harsha. "In this journey of entrepreneurship, I was only very stubborn about loving what I was doing. When I left UK, I was sure that this is the only route. I was happy to work with early startups if they would hire me. But, as luck would have it none of my circle was closely involved in starting up at that time. Hence, I had no other option but to dive in myself," he adds.  On taking the plunge  For Harsha, the inspiration came from Phanindra Sama, Founder of RedBus. In 2006, when Sama discussed his venture plans of going public, Harsha thought it was a crazy idea. But after returning to India he saw the growth of RedBus, which instilled the idea of taking the plunge. He started meeting and discussing ideas with Nandan Reddy (Co-founder, Swiggy) and both saw a huge opportunity in the ecommerce industry with successful platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, e-Bay and more. One thing both were sure of was doing a business that is a mix of technology jobs as well as offline jobs. "We thought that we will find that competitive advantage by being not just a pure software company or not just a pure offline company," adds Harsha They realized saw potential in the unorganised logistics and shipping sector within the ecommerce industry, and thus was born their first venture, Bundl, in August 2013. "We realised that a lot of small and medium ecommerce companies either had their own websites and were trying get more traffic or were selling on places like eBay, Flipkart, Amazon, etc. We considered it and figured out that all of them wanted to manage shipping, but they didn't even know how to get in touch with Blue Dart or FedEx. "This is when we came with a vision to democratise shipping, of course, it was not limited to that, but it was a start. We wanted to ensure that not just a vendor but also a consumer could find the fastest way to ship something from Salem to Darjeeling. For that if we had to involve small services like DTDC, or regional services along with Blue Dart and FedEx, we were okay with it. We just wanted to build that network and make that transaction possible. That is how we started. That is when I decided to come to Bengaluru because all the action was happening here," says Harsha. Things didn't go as smoothly for Bundl as Harsha and Nandan expected. They needed a technology co-founder to bring their vision to reality. According to Harsha, finding the right technology co-founder is crucial for every startup, and that is where everyone struggles. "It wasn't easy (to find a technology partner) as none of my friends were ready to take the risk and finally I had to resign to reality and got a contractor to build the product." By the time they came out with a product, the market dynamics had changed drastically. Platforms like Flipkart and e-Bay had decided to ship products themselves, which made the market smaller. "That's when we knew that we had to change our focus and it wasn't worth the opportunity cost. Thankfully, we didn't have any employees, investors and liabilities at that time," says Harsha. They shut down the operations of Bundl within a year.  Failures are experiences in disguise  After shutting down their first venture, Harsha was not convinced that this was the end of their entrepreneurial journey. Instead, he started looking out for other opportunities and how he could convert his lessons into something fruitful. He says, "Our experience in Bundl made us realise that logistics companies were pathetic at utilising technology to help their business. We took that as a cue, and wanted to start another venture with intersection of technology and logistics. We didn't want any aggregators and build a logistics company that utilised technology to create customer delight." They also saw that technology was making things work with a push of a button. Ola and Uber gaining success through their on-app booking made them realise the potential of hyperlocal delivery, and that was the genesis of Swiggy. "There was no large company with ideas similar to ours and hence we saw a competitive advantage of building a hyperlocal delivery platform that moved things fast in the city," adds Harsha. A result of the founders' dedication and persuasion, within four years of its inception, Swiggy is a successful hyperlocal delivery platform and a household name for online food delivery.    In Part II of the Swiggy Story next week, we will dive deeper into the fascinating story of how Harsha recruited the third co-founder and an early startup team and started scaling Swiggy. And some of his key learnings from the early days that can be very helpful to first time founders.  This article was first published here.

Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in "sensitive" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action.   As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area.  After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing. Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb. Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata. Even Lalbazar department, highest powerful department of Kolkata police, can't go for a raid there without permission from higher authorities. Minority appeasement has reached to such a level that life of an innocent girl does not even bother anyone. Dailyhunt	|Thursday, 22 Feb, 5.42 pm3 months ago4 days ago2 months ago

Though the Kochi Metro offers a comfortable ride to the commuters, it also expects a certain standard in behaviour from them. If you violate these guidelines, you will be slapped with fines or other forms of punishment. Let's take a look at what you need to know before you take a ride in the city's much-awaited rail service.1 No big luggage  Since the metro is meant for daily commuting for people in the city, only backpacks and small bags will be allowed inside. Huge luggage wouldn't fit through the security scanners at the stations and would also take up space in the trains. Hence if you carry a big bag, you might not be allowed to proceed to the ticket counters or platforms. Luggage checking at the stations is similar to that of airport security clearance and if anything dangerous is found, it would invite a jail sentence of four years and a fine of Rs 5,000.      2 These are not allowed  Liquor bottles, cigarette packs and inflammable objects like lighters, match boxes, crackers, kerosene and petrol are also banned in trains, whether carried in hand or inside bags. Packed food and vegetables in your bag will be allowed but food items which could spill cannot be carried inside the trains.  Also read: Thousands throng stations as Kochi Metro begins operations [Photos]    3 No drinking/smoking  Anyone caught drunk during the security procedures, will not be allowed to take the metro and would also be fined Rs 500. Smoking is also strictly prohibited in the stations and trains, and could invite a similar fine.     4 Not your fast food joint  You can buy food and have it at stations with eateries but you cannot eat or drink inside the trains. Commuters who are found chewing gums or betel leaves during security check will not be allowed inside the stations.  Also read: With Modi and Pinarayi on stage, Metro Man draws biggest applause [Video]    5 No graffiti  You could be a wonderful artist but if you decide to showcase your drawing and scribbling talents at the stations, trains or even the metro pillars on the roads, a six-month jail term and a fine of Rs 1,000 awaits you.     6 Mind your space  If you use foul language at the stations or trains or pick on a fight with a co-traveller, you will be chucked out at the next station and slapped with a fine of Rs 500. Also you cannot shout, sing aloud or play loud music from mobile phones or other devices in a metro train.  7 Your are being watched  Multiple CCTV cameras have been set up at every station, platform and train to closely watch the commuters live. Immediate action would be taken against you if any sort of violations of the guidelines is found.  (Photo courtesy: Kochi Metro Rail)  Dailyhunt	|Monday, 19 Jun, 11.19 am

Then we must tell you all that this 32-year-old Bharat Kalicharan was basically serial killer, rapist and extortionist.  Akku Yadav was a man of criminal nature and there were many accusations of tampering with women and sexual assault on him. Bharat Kalicharan, alias Akku Yadav (1972-August 13, 2004), was a 32-year-old rapist and murderer in India who, on August 13, 2004, was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

You wouldn't remember all the seven wonders, but you definitely would remember Taj Mahal. This magnificent monument that is the pride of India has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of people. But, do you think this giant structure would just consist stories of extensive buildings, architectural designs and gardens? Absolutely not!  Apart from the eternal love stories of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz, there is one mysterious tale about secret rooms inside this monument which aren't accessible to the common public. Feeling curious right?  As people discovered about these rooms, many rumoured stories picked up and reached out to people. Visitors of Taj Mahal were intrigued about these rooms and began exploring more and have come with their interesting theories behind this mystery. But what's unusual is why the government is not giving access to these sealed rooms to the public? Let's leave that to the officials. And check out some hideous and appalling stories behind these dark, shabby rooms. It is said that in the deepest and darkest way to the corridors if you closely scrutinise, the arches and the rectangular ventilators above have been sealed with different sizes of marble and tints. These arches take you to the secret stairs which lead to numerous rooms enclosed behind these arches.  Who would want to enter these dark rooms? Many such doorways of chambers in secret rooms underneath the Taj Mahal have been sealed with brick and lime.  There are thousands of arches like these and that have their own stories.  We all know that there is a grave of the beloved Mumtaz at this place, which is at the riverside. But what people don't know is there is a two storey marble structure that hides beside the riverside. Why is it hidden that way?  Another angle that Hindu followers believed was that, Taj Mahal was originally a Hindu temple for Lord Shiva. Shah Jahan covered these ventilators with stone-brick or marble brick to hide any Hindu origin. He hid the Hindu idols and images in those rooms.  The pillars were filled with sculptures of Hindu gods and goddesses.  It is also said that there are 22 locked rooms and not 1089, and these rooms with Hindu paintings and sculptures are hidden by Shah Jahan. The question here arises is why would he want to do that?  The pillars were engraved and filled with sculptures of Hindu gods and goddesses.  If supernatural activities are proved through science, then why not this? People are relating it to a simple logic. The reason for sealing those doorways was that inside chambers are made of marble which convert into calcium carbonate when exposed to excess of carbon dioxide gas, we humans exhale.  So, if these rooms are open to us, we will see these marble walls, go close to them and they will probably deteriorate. Scroll down and check out some more intriguing pictures of unexplored rooms and doors in Taj Mahal.  Mr. Oak states an interesting theory that Aurangzeb had acquired the Taj from the previous owner, Jai Singh, grandson of Raja Mansingh, after selecting this site for the burial of Queen Mumtaz.   Another writer, Dr Godbole says that the Taj Mahal was not built by Shah Jahan but was the Palace of Raja Mansingh.   They say the rooms are kept shut because they are empty rooms.   This opening leads to various rooms that consists of pillars and sculptures that are sealed.  Well, we don't really know what's the truth, but these spooky rooms exist with no reasoned theory or logic and they have persisted throughout the history. Yet it is a masterpiece of architectural style in conception and its execution. Also, take a look at some more facts about Taj Mahal.  Dailyhunt	|Friday, 16 Jun, 9.20 am

Being a Hindu we have thousands rituals and traditions which are to be followed at every step of our life from the time we took birth till our death. These cultures vary from state to state and families to families. Many people still follow them but some consider these traditions as orthodox. But there are some customs, which are followed commonly by the people across India. Today we are discussing about one such famous traditions of Hinduism ' mundan ' (shaving head of baby) which is a part of person's life and it is followed by every Hindu family of India.  Know The Reason Why Hindus Shave Off Their Baby's Hair in 'Mundan' Ceremony      Before going in detail one must know that 'mundan' is a ceremony done after the birth of the baby, in which a baby's head is shaved with full rituals and prayers before the baby turns three. In this puja a priest shaves off hair from the head of baby but in some regions, it is the father of the child who shave off baby's hair.    The family of the baby first gets the date and time fixed on which the mundan ceremony is to be performed and then the whole family along with their relatives rejoice this holy ceremony.     The priest or the father (according to region) shaves off hair from baby's head and then they wash it with holy water (gangajal). Then paste of turmeric and sandalwood is applied on his bare head because it is believed that it sandalwood cool the head of baby and turmeric helps in healing the cuts.    After all these procedure, priest or father offer these shaved hair to the family's deity or to a river, whatever the family beliefs are.    This tradition of mundan is followed among Indians because we believe that a baby is born with undesirable traits from the past life, so this ceremony helps them to get rid of all the impurities so that baby can have good fortune.    According to the ancient scriptures, it is also believed if a baby's birth hair is shaved before it turns three then it helps in stimulate proper growth of the brain and nerves of baby.    And not only this, this ceremony is performed to give freedom from diseases, it provides attainment of strength, health and vigor to the baby. But all these are just the traditional beliefs and hold no concern with reality.    Being an educated person, we all know that every tradition which is followed have a scientific reason behind it but only the difference is that we give them the name of blind rituals and customs.   The real and scientific reason behind following mundan ceremony in Hinduism is that the natural growth of hair on a baby's head is uneven. So, shaving off hair from baby's head leads to proper and healthy growth of hair.    But there are some experts who deny this fact and says that the growth of hair depends on the follicle beneath the scalp and whatever you do with the outgrown hair has no effect on it.    Traditions and their beliefs are many, but it depends on you who to believe and who to not. The only thing is that you must follow what your heart says but with precautions.

Manisha Koirala impresses us in her new avatar in Zoya Akhtar's short film in Lust Stories | Her second innings in Bollywood kick started with unconventionality. And it seems that Manisha Koirala has found love in experimentation. So it is not surprising when we see the actress breaking barriers and doing some hatke roles. One amongst them is the one where she will feature in a Zoya Akhtar directorial. The popular filmmaker, who returns with the concept of anthology, also has Manisha starring as the leading lady in her short as a part of Lust Stories. It has only been a few days since we told you that the Ronnie Screwvala and Ashi Dua anthology Lust Stories will have a digital release. The film was the result of the love and acceptance the 2013 anthology Bombay Talkies received. The same set of four filmmakers, namely, Karan Johar, Dibakar Banerjee, Zoya Akhtar and Anurag Kashyap return with another set of plots in Lust Stories. But unlike the theatrical release of the last, the directors decided that they would aim for a wider global reach with the digital platform Netflix. All the shorts revolve around the dark space of lust and deceit and here's a glimpse from one of them. It features Manisha Koirala chilling peacefully at the lawn of a bungalow accompanied by her co-star Jaideep Ahlwat. The Zoya Akhtar story is supposedly said to revolve around three people, which includes a couple and a husband's friend. As it unveils, a series of skeletons tumble out of the closet filled with deceit, lies and betrayal. On the other hand, besides this one, we have already sneak-peeks into other stories, A look of Kiara Advani and Vicky Kaushal from the Karan Johar directorial was released which featured them as a newly married couple. The said story also has Neha Dhupia. Anurag Kashyap's story revolves around Radhika Apte whereas Dibakar's story has Bhumi Pednekar among others. Speaking of Manisha Koirala, the 90s diva also has other interesting projects in hand which includes the Sanjay Dutt biopic. The Rajkumar Hirani directorial has Manisha in the role of Sanjay's mother Nargis Dutt whereas Paresh Rawal essays the role of her husband and veteran actor Sunil Dutt.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asian+age-epaper-asianage/demonetisation+a+hit+or+a+miss-newsid-72697468| Features Demonetisation: A hit or a miss? | We get celebrities to give their take on a current issue each week and lend their perspective to a much-discussed topic. As per the data released by the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday, about Rs 15.28 lakh crore worth of demonetised notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 made its way back to them by way of deposits by public. Given that the total amount of currency taken out of circulation was Rs 15.44 lakh crore, it seems that about 99 per cent of the currency was returned after demonetisation on November 8 last year. One of the points raised during the exercise was eradication of black money. However, since most of the money has found its way back to the banks, we ask economists and prominent bankers if the exercise has been a success or a failure. Are there other aspects that have been brought on by demonetisation that can be used to call it a success?   'Our leaders should think of long term benefits' K.M Chaitanya, filmmaker  The irony is we are not even expecting demonetisation to be a success anymore. We just don't want it to be a monumental failure. We are hoping someone in the government will be able to salvage it. And next time our leaders should think of long-term benefits of their actions instead of short-term hype. The irony is that the general public isn't infuriated solely because of the demonetisation dud.  'The idea of cashless transActions, internet banking gives more transparency' Sri Krishna Charan, banker and team leader at HSBC  Despite the various concerns over the phenomenon, I'm actually for demonetisation - and always have been. It was hailed as a bold step by the government when it was introduced, and despite a few shortcomings, I still stand by its implementation. The idea of cashless transactions, and internet banking gives more transparency and will go a long way towards helping the economy. Maybe we don't realise it just yet. People are aware now that the government is watching their every step, and the source of the cash can't be hidden anymore. It's also progressive for today's generation, who handle most of their payments through their phones. Maybe it can't be called an outright success just yet, but the signs are highly encouraging.  'The exercise has been a complete failure' Mohan Guruswamy, chairman, centre for policy alternatives society  The exercise has been a complete failure because it didn't alert any black money and completely disrupted the economy. It rendered many people jobless in the construction horticulture sector, and small retail sectors. It caused a loss of 2 per cent in the GDP. Also they introduced digital money charges - 1 per cent on any transaction. Loss to RBI, cost of new currency notes, all together came to `4 lakh crore without any concrete benefits. Now the usage of digital money has come down to the pre-November level. Still a good sum of demonetised money has not come to banks. We can say it's from the rural belt who don't know anything about it. Even the soldiers at Siachen lost money due to this. The black money problem still remains. Ninety-six per cent is there in property, gold, money at foreign accounts, benami ownership of shares and property. Nothing of that was touched. What it did was it took cash flow from the system and made it a complete gimic. An act of vandalism and unprecedented stupidity. The number of new tax return filed grew only 23 per cent whereas the previous year it was 27 per cent so the whole notion that people are running to pay taxes is wrong.  'It is pretty evident that more black money was circulating' Nikhil Rajan, branch Manager, Syndicate Bank  When talking about the success rate of demonetisation, it is really unfortunate to say that, to a large extent, the step had not served its purpose though it was one of the major steps our economy had seen in past few years in terms of bringing out black money. Almost 99 per cent of the `500, `1,000 currency notes that were in circulation have been deposited back with the banks and if the figures are to be believed then it can never be such that this drastic step was taken to bring back just `16,000 crore black money. It is pretty much evident that more black money was circulating in the economy but people were able to make it white despite demonetisation. The government should therefore with foremost priority check this and find out how much black money has been converted. The next thing is about digitisation. The ruling government had urged everyone to switch to digital banking and make the economy corruption free, but the government itself has not taken any strict steps to implement digitisation. Making every transaction cashless and slowly cutting down the cash mode payment method for various activities will eventually help to make banking activities digital. However, nothing of this sort has been done. In a way the government itself seems to be a bit confused as none of the things that the PM said during his speech while announcing demonetisation has come into effect.  'It was a misguided attempt, and designed to fail' Anil Dharker, writer and columnist  In my most honest opinion, the exercise was a complete and utter failure. It was an entirely misguided attempt and was designed to fail since its inception. It caused incredible hardship to thousands of people all over the country, mainly poor people and daily wage workers. People who own small businesses, lost their business. The whole idea of demonetisation was to get all the black money back and give the country cleaner and whiter economy. In order to achieve this, they got back the highest denominator notes (`1,000), but they replaced it with an even higher denominator (`2,000). Black currencies are made from large currency notes, but here the point is missed! In hindsight, it doesn't even seem like it was a demonetisation - to me, it seems merely a note exchange. What was the purpose of it all? Consider this, because of this, there was a decrease in the GDP growth, the lowest in the last three years since it has affected all sectors. A step in the right direction is digitisation. But, in a country like ours, which is still a third world country, it doesn't happen overnight since the majority of the population is poor. A huge population works in the informal sector in jobs such as daily wage earners, vegetable/fruit sellers, electricians, plumbers, local shop workers and so on. Give them space and gradually, the shift will happen. Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 03 Sep, 12.28 pm
https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/apherald-epaper-apherald/nirbhaya+rapists+ploy+to+escape+death-newsid-67340315| India News Nirbhaya rapists ploy to escape death? | When Supreme Court of India confirmed death sentence to the rapists of Nirbhaya, entire country rejoiced and many said finally justice though delayed has been delivered. Except for few NGOs and the family members of the rapists, everyone congratulated Supreme Court for the tough punishment to the rapists who raped 23 year old Jyothi Singh in a moving bus in Delhi in the most brutal manner and then murdered her in 2012.      Now with all doors closed, Nirbhaya rapists are coming with another ploy to escape death. Already the defense counsel announced that they will file review petition. Experts say the following are the options available for the rapists to escape death.       Review Petition   They can file review petition as article 137 of the Constitution provides for review of the verdict pronounced by the Supreme Court. The filing of review petition is governed by the Supreme Court Rules. Anil Kumar, Supreme Court lawyer says "A review petition should be filed within 30 days of the pronouncement of judgment by the Supreme Court." He however added that in the case like Nirbhaya gang rape, review petition can only be entertained n the ground of an error apparent on the face of the record.  However the chances of review petition getting favourable result is very low as it generally goes to the same judge if not retired or the same bench which previously heard the case.  Judges can also first examine the merit of the review petion in their chamber. Atul Kumar adds There is no open court hearing, so there is no chance of oral arguments by the counsel during the examination of the review petition,"   Curative Petition  Curative petition is not mentioned in the Constitution, unlike a review petition. It is the creation of the judiciary. Before 2002, there was nothing like curative petition. It can be filed after the Supreme Court has dismissed the review petition against the final conviction. Atul Kumar says "The apex court created the system of curative petition to ensure that there was no miscarriage of justice. But, some use this tool to delay final settlement of the judicial process," It will also be first decided in the chamber of judges just like review petition. On specific request, the judges may allow the open court hearing. court can agree to hear a curative petition only if the petitioner proves that the final conviction violates the principle of natural justice. Accrding to Atul Kumar,rapists in the Nirbhaya gangrape case will have to get their curative petition certified by a senior advocate pointing out substantial grounds for admitting the same by the Supreme Court.  If the majority of the judges agree that the curative petition has merit in it, the same can be listed for hearing in the court preferably by the same bench, which disposed off the case last time. The Supreme Court has also made it clear that a curative petition must be viewed with circumspection and should be a tool which is rare than regular in use. In 15 years only two curative petitions have been successful.   Mercy Petition  When all the doors of judiciary are shut, one can file mercy petition approaching President of India. President cacn commute a death sentence under Article 72 of the constitution. However President has to act on the advice of the council of Ministers. . Under the existing rules, the Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal agency and according to its opinion the President decides the matter. Nirbhaya rapists can file a mercy petition through their lawyer from Tihar jail or families or prison officials. They can even send written petition or email their plea to the Home Ministry of the President's Secretariat. Atul Kumar says "Now, even the decision of the President on the mercy petition can be challenged in the Supreme Court on the ground or inordinate delay," There is no time frame within which the Preisdent is bound to decide on the mercy petiton. Already there are lot of mercy petitions before President's office.  However President Pranab Mukherjee set a record by clearing as many as 32 mercy pleas, some of them pending since 2000, when KR Narayanan was the President. Of them President rejected 28 or little less than 90% of the petitions.  Dailyhunt	|Sunday, 07 May, 9.16 am

A rapidly growing market, online clothing rental is said to be gaining popularity within developing economies in Asia Pacific, due to the need for an economic option. Increasing popularity of e-commerce further welcome start ups to this business.  Online clothing rentals  About Online rental services are expected to be utilized by those who are fashion conscious, but lack finances to procure clothing items. Rental services are considered cost effective especially for women. Ethnic wear is an item of particular interest in the market. Ethnic wear rental market is expected to expand given increasing incidence of festivals and other events and high costs associated with them.  How was the report prepared?  Fact The report has incorporated data from interviews with top officials as well as online/offline research and expert consultations. Major companies including American companies Lending Luxury and Le Tote, Indian companies Secret Wardrobe and Shared Wardrobe and Brazilian company Dress &Go were profiled. What drives the market?  Drivers North America and Europe hold the highest market share. Asia Pacific is third with a projected CAGR at 11.4%. Online rentals are expected to catch on in developing Asia Pacific economies including India and China due to increasing purchasing power complemented by dearth of economical fashionable options. Increased social acceptance for rentals and flourishing e-commerce facilitated by a technology boom also helped the market.  Booming online rental businesses in India  Key players Start-ups have been mushrooming in India's online fashion rental space, with the existing ones attracting seed funding. Increasing preference for high-end fashion goods alongside a lack of affordable options have made room for major ventures including Flyrobe, Swishlist and Klozee. Often charging a security deposit along with the rental fee, the order is delivered anywhere between 3 hours and 2 days.  Imagine no possession  Details While North America is the market leader, Asia Pacific is soon purported to catch up through demand driven growth fuelled by India and China. While women's market share comes up to 58%, number of male consumers is projected to increase. Ethnic wear along with the western wear segment is further expected to increase market share. The market can trigger a "no ownership" fashion culture.  Will the Indian market reach its potential?  Future Often selling major brands and designer wear, the start-ups are booming when Indians get smarter about their fashion expenses. Further consumers exhibit a decreasing propensity to spend on luxury one time events like festivals or bachelor parties. Societal pressure to appear fashionable might potentially end financial culture structured around long term investments, to one that provides a cheaper, yet larger array of options.  Recovery: The down side  Fact Shilpa Bhatia, an early entrant in the rental market, notes cost recovery is challenging, "We also have to look after the maintenance of the garment.

A young lady in making, Taapsee Pannu is perceived as a fierce actress and a woman with a 'class'. Her absolutely stunning choice of movies that she opted for while her acting career in Bollywood, has made her the most outrageous and audacious diva. The Delhi born Sikhni made her first debut in Bollywood from the movie Chashme Baddoor (2013) followed by Baby (2015). Although her bold role was first recognised in Shoojit Sircar's Pink  as Meenal Arora and thereby she continued her best work in the film  Naam Shabana , the pre-sequel of Baby as Shabana Khan.  As per the reports by Bangalore Mirror, Taapsee Pannu says "Film Industry has taught me a lot of patience. Back in times I often got into fights with boys because I was short-tempered." Growing up, she continued to fight hard against fears and preconceived notions and after all 'fortune favours the bold'. She got the offer to work in Pink, she took the challenge and never looked back.  From following her passion despite the concerns her parents voiced, to paving the path for a career that is poised handling the difficult situations, Taapsee Pannu is our poster girl for making bold moves. So, let's take a look at her most fierce dialogues till date. More power to you Taapsee! A majority of Indian men perceive that almost every other girl on this planet who drinks with her guy mates have the tendency to do sex with them.  Of course, 'itni raat ko kahan thi?', 'shareef ghar ki ladkiyan der raat tak ghar se baahar nahi rehti', blah-blah, are the major questions that the society asks. Instead, if a boy is out, people say, 'ladka hai kuch bhi karey, tum ladki ho!' Just the minute and hour hands are sufficient to decide the character of a girl.  Yeah, 'NO' is defined clearly in the dictionary. Guys must get this straight into their heads if a girl says 'NO' that means she's not into you. Just stop!  I would like to ask the society, why is it that a drunk man is accountable for his own self, while a drunk woman is treated as a public property? Think of it...!  If a woman is drinking, smoking or having a late night dinner at a restaurant, she's wrong. But if a man does so, he's 'masculine. Oh! What a hypocrisy. A girl is not allowed to do whatever her heart desires, but a man has full freedom to do so. Why? Is it because the women were created to be just a domestic slave?  If a girl goes to a party and she likes to drink, that doesn't mean she's your property. If she talks to you she's not someone to be taken as 'Here For Sex'.  Really? It's like a happy independent woman says, "Hey, man! I live alone at my home. You can come anytime for sex." Of course, and why not? A girl has got no family, no ambitions and absolutely no happiness of living with herself. Just sex on her mind! Right, guys?  Yes, bring it on. Don't threaten us because we girls acted against the injustice done to us, we're ready to face anything.  A stereotypical perception. Gaze at the girl when she's out at night, she must be here for something else.  Because she will think a hundred times while reaching to a decision. Believing is important. I'm much impressed by the beauty and boldness of this woman. Taapsee Pannu has always been a wise picker while choosing her films. Her decision to pursue such great movies and delivering the harsh reality of this society on the face of people has won million hearts including mine. I respect this young lady for whatever she is and had been ever since. WittyFeed wishes her all the luck in her future endeavours!  That's all folks!  Like, share, comment in the section below.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Reservation before Independence!      Reservation was actually a blessing in disguise from the British Raj. In 1933, British introduced the Communal Award, according to which separate representation was to be provided for the Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans, Dalit. The depressed classes were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from special constituencies in which voters belonging to the depressed classes only could vote. This was protested by Mahatma Gandhiji and he went on a hunger strike. It is then various prominent leaders like Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had an agreement with Gandhiji referred as Poona Pact. However it was still continued though norms were made a lot easier. Gandhiji knew the tactics of British 'Divide and Rule' policy. He saved the nation form it at that time, but alas! he couldn't have guessed that it would be such a major issue in coming years.    Reservation before Independence!

Unfortunately, even after 70 years of independence, affordable quality healthcare facilities for the common Indians are still a myth. It doesn't imply that technological advancement in India in healthcare is not up to the mark; rather there a sharp contrast in mass healthcare as affordability has become a serious issue. Rural population of India, which comprises of 70% of the total population, is still deprived of the latest innovations and technologies in healthcare.   Be it the ever increasing supply-demand gap, low insurance penetration or costly treatment of terminal diseases - there is an urgent need to relook the healthcare sector at present. The proposals of National Health Policy under Ayushman Bharat announced in Union Budget 2018 definitely look to be promising from a bigger perspective. Although the budget has allocated Rs 1200 crore for a major overhaul, still there is amid food for thought. The lack of skilled health personnel in both urban and rural sector is a critical issue in India including front line health workers, mid level care providers and allied health professionals. No doubt, PPP model can be a good alternative to existing system. Side by side, strategic purchasing along with maintaining standard management guidelines, negotiating costs and consistent monitoring of Healthcare service provided can definitely change the scenario.  According to Mr Nageswaran C K , Facility Director , Fortis Malar Hospital, Chennai ," The existing healthcare infrastructure is just not enough to meet the needs of the population. There is no enough supply of operating beds -, especially in smaller towns. In smaller towns doctors and the patient ratio is low. Lack of trained nurses and primary health centers is also one of the basic problems in Indian healthcare infrastructure and tertiary health centers are mainly in large cities. The Medico-legal issues still plague the doctors. There are also high import duties for high-end medical equipment and consumables making the investment very high and there is a lack of infrastructure for end-of- life care. There is no subsidy on land, power, and other inputs for private hospitals - but the tremendous pressure to keep prices low. Anyhow, the primary need is to strengthen the infrastructure in smaller towns and rural areas. The government should also encourage and incentivize the doctors to work in rural areas. According to Dr. Usha Manjunath, Director IIHMR,"National Health Protection Mission is a positive step, but implementation is tough and time lines for positive impact are difficult to be predicted. With increasing use of high end technology in everyday practice is further pushing the healthcare costs up. Essential medical drugs and technologies is another key aspect of healthcare infrastructure. Success of Jan Aushadhi in some areas needs to be replicated across the nation. Price regulation of medical products and drugs continue to be taken up. Health Information System, data quality, accuracy, completeness, security and integration issues still need to be addressed. We have a long way to go in using HIS for evidence based public health programmes, measuring of outputs/outcomes, EMR and Clinical Information Systems. A lacuna in Leadership from political to organizational levels across public and private health sector is hindering all aspects of health system functioning in the country. "In India, barring the Centers of Excellence, both in the Central and State level, most other government hospitals lag behind private ones. In terms of service to the community, government hospitals are overcrowded and maintenance of infrastructure of facilities and hygiene is poor. Comparatively, decision making for purchase, maintenance and utilization of medical equipment is much better in private hospitals. Recruitment of medical personnel is specialty care is difficult in government hospitals especially in smaller towns and remote areas.. Implementation of regulatory mechanisms and quality control is highly variable in most hospitals. Thus a far sighted approach with regard to basic healthcare infrastructure can definitely bridge the gap between urban and rural spheres and definitely help India in affordable quality healthcare, which can pave a new path in medical tourism too.

Both these Chinese smartphone makers launched their new mid-range smartphones in India in the previous week. While Vivo launched the much talked about Vivo V9, Oppo followed that up by announcing the launch of the Oppo F7 just a few days later. Both the smartphones being made by sister companies, share a lot of similarities. There are, however, several differences too. Interestingly, Oppo has announced that it will sell the Oppo F7 in a one-time flash sale one week before the handset officially goes on sale across the country. This sale is quite unique in that it will also be held "offline" across 77 authorised Oppo retail stores across the country.

Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra  Archer , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video -  #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!! Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY  - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018  The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side. As he has failed to recover from the side strain.  The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.  Photo Credit: Getty Images. He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp. After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance. The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman. Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.  Photo Credit: IPL. If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane. Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case. The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him. The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over. In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils. The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs. Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15. About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

Secondly, do you even know what he looks like?  For those who've no idea about what he looks like, here's his picture -      Handsome and Hot, right?   No doubt, you'll be thinking, why he isn't in Bollywood? It seems, he's not interested to act in movies (or maybe some other reasons)  Well, he might not be into acting, but according to daily.bhaskar report, he has been the showstopper for designer Sanjana John for Will Lifestyle India Fashion Week in the year 2010. Since then, he disappeared. Don't you think that it would've been a treat to watch Sushmita Sen's sibling on-screen? But anyways, maybe he has some different plans.  Rajeev Sen is a gym-freak. Yeah, look at his body - Do you think that it's perfect to inspire a person who is a lazy bump? Hehe! Anyways, Rajeev Sen has a good body, and is handsome as well.  Check out these pictures -   Fitness Freak!!      White color suits him, right?      Look at that smile!!      Is it just me or even you think that in this picture he's looking like Ranveer Singh?      Workout like this!!      And then this is what you'll get - Hawtt!     Other than that; Rajeev Sen was rumored to be dating Kratika Sengar in the past. Yes, I'm talking about Kratika Sengar who is now happily married to Nikitin Dheer. No doubt, she is gorgeous. Back to the past, as I mentioned Rajeev and Kratika were rumored to be dating, it seems that it was just a rumor. Yes, actually, when they were asked about their relationship rumors, Kratika made it clear by saying "Are you kidding me? No, I'm not at all in love. Rajeev is just a good friend of mine. This wasn't the only thing that kept him in news. There was another dating rumor. This time, he was rumored to be dating Kriti Sanon's sister "Nupur Sanon". There were rumors that they met each other at a party and then they fell in love and started dating.Rumors, I tell you can be ridiculous sometimes. Sushmita Sen's brother was certainly NOT dating any of them.  Sushmita Sen Sibling -  On the other end, if you want to follow him on Instagram, then click here. Any thoughts?

The girl, who was seen in the 1.7-minute-long video, is believed to be a resident of Bhadrak district. It appears that the male partner has shot their intimate moments, in the know of the girl. So far, no complaint has been registered with police in this regard. The incident will surely give fresh headache to the cops as the police are still investigating similar cases including the sensational case involving a youth and a girl from Chandbali in Bhadrak district. The youth had allegedly uploaded hundreds of sex videos to various pornographic websites.  Few days later, the youth was found dead on the banks of Kuakhai river here. Concerned over the situation, Odisha police had earlier issued advisory to all the district SPs and public to check circulation of such videos on the internet. "An advisory has been given to all the district SPs and police officers to follow a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with cases right from examining the objectionable images and videos that are going viral on social media platforms till filing the cases," DGP RP Sharma had told after inaugurating a cyber forensic division on the premises of the State Forensic Laboratory here in November last year.

Arun is a native of Thiruvananthapuram but is settled in Mumbai. He has been a resident of Houston, Texas for the last four years.   Divya took to her Facebook page to confirm the news about her second marriage. Besides sharing her wedding photo, she wrote, "Thank you so much for the love, blessings and prayers. My gratitude to everyone who sent us their blessings and good wishes. #love #justmarried #blessed #wedding #gratitude #goodwishes #sreeguruvayurappantemple #sincerely."     Divya, who was one of the shining stars during the late 1990s, has worked with the actors such as Mohanlal, Mammootty and Dileep, and with directors Bharathan, IV Sasi, Sibi Malayil and Lohithadas. She has played the female lead in over 50 movies and has now started a new inning in life.  In 2016, she ended her 14-year-old marriage with Dr Sudhir Shekhar and moved back from the USA to Kochi along with her children Arjun and Meenakshi. According to reports, the actress decided to end the marriage due to Sudhir's extramarital affairs and egoistic nature. Reportedly, Divya's deep interest towards dance and acting hadn't also gone well with Sudhir. The actress opened a dance school in Houston and soon established a successful career as a dance teacher. However, her husband was not happy with Divya's career interests and wanted her to stay at home.  Sudhir allegedly asked Divya to shut down her dance school but she refused to do so. Later, she moved back to Kochi along with her children and slowly resumed her first love dancing. In an earlier interview with a popular Malayalam magazine, she expressed her feelings on her separation with her ex-husband. "I kept telling myself, I will not be weak as I am a sensitive person all my life," she said, adding, "During my separation, I was strong as it would affect a lot of people who care about me. It is this thought that gave me the strength to withstand that split." Divya was trained in Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, and Mohiniyattam at a very tender age. She was crowned 'Kalathilakom' at the Kerala school kalolsavam in 1990 and 1991. She has presented a variety of Indian dance and art forms on Doordarshan. She has also performed at various Indian dance festivals and international stages throughout North America, Europe and the Gulf. Later, she started her dance class in the US. Many youngsters joined her dance school, all thanks to her popularity as an actress. She used to turn mythological tales and Biblcal stories into Bharatanatyam.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/indo+nepal+dam+faces+uncertain+future-newsid-80865887| Opinion Indo-Nepal dam faces uncertain future | A 5,600 MW power project along the Mahakali river, which flows between Nepal and Uttarakhand is yet another sub-Himalayan hydropower project causing a great deal of concern, not only among over 30,000 affected families but also environmentalists, social activists and others. The current agitation against this huge hydropower dam is a reminder of the previous such agitations against dams that have already been built in Uttarakhand in the central Himalayas, such as the 2,400 MW Tehri dam, which continues to face stiff problems even years after its commissioning. The uprooted local people complain about not having been adequately compensated even to this day.  The Pancheshwar dam, which is to be built on the Mahakali will be one of the tallest dams in the world. Flowing from Nepal through Uttarakhand, the river enters Uttar Pradesh, flowing south-east across the plains to join the Ghaghra river, a tributary of the Ganga. It descends from 11,800 feet at Kalapani to 660 feet as it enters the Terai plains, offering an unutilised hydropower potential. In fact, with a proposed height of 315 metres, Pancheshwar will be the second largest dam in the world. The project is roughly estimated to cost Rs 35,000 crore, the construction is scheduled to begin in September 2018 and the dam is to be ready by September 2026. Social activists like Medha Patkar and environmentalists like Sundar Lal Bhuguna have already expressed their opposition to the dam. While activists are worried over the uprooting and rehabilitation of villagers from the dam site, environmentalists have expressed concern over its serious upstream and downstream environmental impacts. Some geologists say that the dam site is a seismically active fault. Uttarakhand is in Category 4 and 5 on the seismic map of India and has experienced several major and minor quakes at regular intervals over the last century. Therefore, doubts over the safety of the proposed dam are natural. Landslides are also one of the major devastating natural hazards causing major damage to life and property sometimes. In 1998, a landslide near Okhimath in Rudraprayag district in the upper catchment area of the Ganga claimed 101 lives and rendered hundreds homeless. Thus, on the basis of whatever is being said on the social, environmental and safety dimensions, even some leaders of political parties, like the Communist Party of Nepal and the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) have also opposed the idea of this big hydropower project. Some UKD leaders point out to how people uprooted by Tehri dam continue to suffer years after it was built. The Pancheshwar Dam reservoir is expected to submerge some 123 villages in the three districts of Uttarakhand, namely Pithoragarh, Almora and Champawat, and cover some 11,600 hectares of land, including 9,100 hectares of dense forests. Therefore, the opposition to the dam is gradually intensifying. Alerted by this anti-dam movement, the government has conducted public hearings on the issue. However, these open house hearings of complaints and suggestions have not helped in assuaging the feelings of the affected people. Hollow assurances The repeated assurances by the government on their proper rehabilitation and adequate compensation, have not helped pacify the affected locals and they continue to stick to their guns. Fearing further intensification of the agitation against the dam, the Uttarakhand government is understood to have now formulated a draft policy for the rehabilitation of affected families. According to some reports, a proposal has been made to pay the displaced people six times more than the existing circle rate in the affected areas. It may be mentioned here that parleys between India and Nepal on the possibility of building this dam have been going on since 1956 when for the first time the then Central Water Commission had evinced interest in such a project, to be beneficial to both countries. But the actual ground work towards achieving this goal did not begin until the early 90s, which eventually culminated in a treaty between the two countries in 1996 called the Mahakali Treaty. Subsequently, a plan to prepare a detailed project report was put in place, but problems over a different set of issues between the two countries remained unresolved and affected progress on the dam. The MoU between the two countries was signed after a long gap in 2014 and the Pancheshwar Development Authority was created. In the meantime, the prime ministers of both countries also took interest in early completion of this mega project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nepal's outgoing Prime Minster Sher Bahadur Deuba are understood to have discussed the project keenly during their respective visits. This dam, to be located about 2.5 km downstream of the confluence of Mahakali and Sarju rivers near the famous Pancheshwar temple in Champawat district of Uttarakhand, is expected to irrigate 2,59,000 hectares of land in India and 1,70,000 hectares in Nepal. Interestingly, this river is also proposed as a source for one of the Himalayan components of the Indian river interlinking project.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/financial+chronicle-epaper-finance/the+inside+story+recapturing+pok-newsid-71945709| Columnists The Inside Story: RECAPTURING POK | You would have thought that once the repelling of the raiders began and the tide in the wages of an attritional war of 1947-48 in an inhospitable terrain began turning the tide, the Indian army after notching up crucial wins was scornful and in a hurry. Yes, it was. For the Pakistan Army and those masquerading as Afridis and Tribals were fleeing like ducklings. Nehru of course being a pacifist was wearing a cloak of jurisprudence, embroidered as it was with the clothes of wisdom. He had chosen to ignore all the impassioned pleas from his eyes and ears, his private secretary Dwarka Nath Kachru who had been dispatched to the border areas and was reporting real time from the frontline for the over burdened PM. With Nehru having followed Lord Mountbatten's cue to take the Kashmir imbroglio to Unite Nations, Nehru was limited and sequestered in his approach in those crucial days when the present boundaries on the map of J& K could have been altered with ease.  The state of J&K, which acceded to India on October 26, 1947 was bigger than modern day France, but over the years Pakistan and China have chipped away to reduce it to a much smaller entity. Despite all the wars, India strangely has never attempted to reclaim many of the areas that it lost in 1947-48 till the UN mandated ceasefire came into being on January 1, 1949. Skirmishes have continued over time, but India has never played aggressor by coveting what principally, legally and morally belonged to it. PoK was lost due to Mohd Ali Jinnah's overzealousness, Gilgit and Baltistan due to British chicanery and subterfuge, chunks of Akashi Chin and areas in the Karakoram for no material rhyme or reason. In recent memory, it was NSA Ajit Doval who reminded Pakistan and China in May 2015 that India shared a 106 km border with Afghanistan as well, by stating very categorically that India had not forgotten its claim on PoK. Earlier in the same month, PM Modi told his Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang in Beijing that PoK is Indian territory under dispute with Pakistan, expressing his concern over the One Belt One Road linking Kashmir to Gwadar using PoK. That the present right wing dispensation has PoK on its radar is obvious, more so now that China is strategically building an economic corridor which extends through what is perceived to be Indian territory - PoK - occupied by the Pakistan Army regulars in conjunction with Pathans and Afridis in October 1947. Its importance cannot be underscored and given China's rising remit and heft in the area, its magnified threat percept to Indian security simply cannot be ignored. Further, the tendrils of JeM and LeT function out of these areas as they infiltrate across the LoC to attack Indian military installations and security forces.  The chase and the standoff  On 1 November 1948 while the snow fell and bitter frost and chill enveloped the valleys across the Zoji La, the first offensive was developed by the combined efforts of the Indian Army's tanks and infantry. Among various narratives on the war, one of the standout descriptions is that of SN Dass and Dharam Pal in Recapture of Kargil and Drass. Examples of individual acts of heroism and reckless courage in this battle were many. In the highly tense situation before the final knockout blow while the enemy was firing from every cliff and every gorge, it was the general officer commanding (GOC) who personally took charge and led the assault. Gen. Thimmaya was at the head of the advancing columns and personally visited every section and brought the various columns-armour, infantry and gunners-into proper formation with a view to poise them against the enemy. A brilliant tactician, he realised the necessity for firepower to blast the enemy out at the Zoji La heights. Astonishingly, he ordered the deployment of a squadron of Stuart MK-VI tanks of the 7 Light Cavalry, compelling the engineers to cut a path into the rocky terrain in less than three weeks to build an eight-kilometre-long track that could take the width and weight of the tanks. To make the precipitous climb, the tanks had to be dismantled and physically pushed up by the jawans-to an altitude where they had never been used before. The general himself had a narrow escape, and the death-defying tempo, enhanced all the more by his presence, compelled his men to dash forward regardless of the consequences. The very appearance of the tanks dampened the morale of the bewildered Pakistanis who either fled or were vanquished. Once Zoji La was taken, the road to Kargil was reopened and Ladakh was safe. Ultimately, on November 24, Kargil was retaken. After the bitter fighting in which tanks played a prominent role, Indian troops entered Matayan on November 3. The next battle, and which perhaps could be regarded as equally fierce as the previous one, lasted for a full 10 days. It was the grim battle for Batkundi Hill and in this the men of the Royal Gorkha Regiment under Col. Sukhdev Pathania and the Patialas under Col. Sukhdev Singh played a notable part. The credit for capturing the most important and fiercely defended feature on this range went to the Royal Gorkhas who, in the freezing conditions of Matayan, waded through and back in the half-frozen streams and finally captured the important feature on this range which subsequently was given the name of their commander: Anand Feature. On November 24, Kargil was retaken. After the bitter fighting in which tanks played a prominent role, Indian troops entered Matayan on November 3. The next battle, and which perhaps could be regarded as equally fierce as the previous one, lasted for a full 10 days. Also in this battle, tanks provided the firing cover for the assault. After its rout at Batkundi Hill, the enemy was at sixes and sevens. The Patialas, who were to march ahead after the capture of the feature and hold the line of control (LoC), had no rest. Soon they were joined by other battalions. Major Qureshi, the commanding officer on the enemy side in this sector, received a bullet in his foot near Drass. He managed to limp his way back. Indian troops then kept up their speed till they reached Kharal Bridge, five miles from Kargil. The enemy had crossed over the Bridge and burnt it, destroying the base planks. Moving onto the higher ground, they took to sniping at the advancing Indian positions. A little distance before Kharal Bridge, one of the platoons of the Royal Gorkhas led by Major Kochar crossed the half-frozen rivers in the dead of the night and sneaked up on the enemy side while another platoon of the Gorkhas marched ahead on the main road to Kargil. Using sniper fire, the enemy killed five Gorkhas and wounded a few others. By now they were in full retreat and by November 24, Indian troops had cleared all the mountain ranges on both sides of Kargil Valley. Ladakh had been secured again. The same gameplay was reprised in 1999 when they took high ground in the same area. Once again at great cost of men, India cleared out the enemy.  The net was being gathered in  The enemy in this battle was not just outmanoeuvred and outwitted but caught unawares by the presence of tanks and armoured columns. Pakistani officers found it difficult to believe that tanks could reach the Zoji La and kept on telling their men that the tanks were jeeps camouflaged as such. Thinking that they would not be evicted, they had stockpiled on supplies, foodstuff, clothing and uniform in Pandras, Drass and Kargil. Local gossip had it that they were ultimately left with only two boxes of ammunition and therefore had to flee. But the truth was that they were shaken by Gen.Thimmaya's tactics and use of tanks at such a high altitude. This was a decisive blow in the war, the longest and most attritional battle fought by the Indian Army. The defeat in the Kargil sector naturally resulted in the complete withdrawal of enemy forces from the Leh sector. The entire Zanskar and Nubra Valleys were cleared by the troops and national militia. The civilian population everywhere between Zoji La and Kargil welcomed the liberators. Harrowing tales were narrated of extortion and other misdeeds by the enemy. The conquest of Kargil synchronised with the capture of Mendhar in Jammu province. At this juncture, Pakistan thought India was going full tilt towards Gilgit in Kashmir and Kotli and Bhimber in Jammu. To keep abreast with the developments in Kashmir, Nehru had dispatched his private secretary and 'eyes and ears' Dwarka Nath Kachru to the frontline. Remember that India was coming out of a bloody partition and was trying to find its feet as a nation state. These were cataclysmic times and required an urgent and ceaseless feed of information. While the Prime Minister attended to matters of state, his roving private secretary surveyed the borders to post information on the actual developments in the frontline. Previously unpublished correspondence reveal that Nehru's pacifism-guided by the principles of fair play and the fact that India had referred the Kashmir matter to the United Nations erroneously on Lord Mountbatten's insistence-meant that the Indian Army was refused permission to go all the way and reclaim what eventually became PoK and the Northern Areas. In fact, Kachru, himself a Kashmiri, chose to question the Prime Minister's decisionmaking. But Nehru, as always, chose to walk the path of straight and narrow, his idealism once again trashing pragmatism. Some of Kachru's correspondence is extremely damaging, the prism far too revealing of how the Indian Army first pushed back the raiders and then vanquished the Pakistan Army regulars, even having them on the run. Previously unpublished correspondence reveal that Nehru's pacifism-guided by the principles of fair play and the fact that India had referred the Kashmir matter to the United Nations erroneously on Lord Mountbatten's insistence-meant that the Indian Army was refused permission to go all the way and reclaim what eventually became PoK and the Northern Areas. In an assessment from these areas, Kachru wrote to Nehru on 4 December 1948: "I don't know what reasons we have had for issuing instructions to halt our advance at this point and after discussions with Sheikh Abdullah, Bakshi and senior Army officers, I feel convinced that it would not be advisable to withdraw or even halt at the places which we are holding at present (don't know whether it is under UN pressure). I am personally convinced that the recapture of Kargil has committed us to the capture of Skardu because in order to hold the frontier illaqas of Ladakh and Kargil and to give the necessary security to the civil administration and the people, it would be necessary for us to liquidate the enemy pockets between Skardu and Ladakh and between Skardu and Kargil. The victory in the frontier areas has given a tremendous psychological and political advantage to us and the corresponding repercussions in the enemy set up have also been quite favourable to us. There is a state of chaos and confusion on the other side heightened by a rift in the leadership. The Raja of Khaplu in Skardu is reported to be in open revolt against Pakistan and is ready to help us. If we advance ahead on this sector, we might consolidate along lines, which will ultimately prove vital to us at the time the actual ceasefire order becomes effective. This march towards Skardu would naturally ease the situation in the Guraiz sector and we might perhaps be able to advance at least as far as Burzil or even beyond. All this might naturally give us a line, which may be easy to defend and maintain even in the event of a possible division. In the Jammu province holding on to Mendhar alone would not be enough unless we try to go a little ahead and secure strategic and vital points which will ultimately give us the necessary degree of security. I would have actually suggested a full blast advance towards Muzzafarabad because looking at the whole scenario from the approaching ceasefire, which seems to be inevitable, it would be very advantageous to us if we have already reached and consolidated along the points and lines which we will ultimately demand as points and lines of demarcation between what we should have as our own and what may be left to be administered on our behalf." This advice was ignored; the result was a calamity. As part of this continuing interface with Nehru, Kachru kept sending him confidential reports from the Valley. Earlier, on 8 July 1948, he had also sent a note. While the focus of the note was on political content and the state of the Sheikh Abdullah administration, which was worse for wear, it is the military side that was equally important, in the main, regarding the morale of the troops fighting. Kachru wrote to Nehru: "The military operations are going on successfully and according to plan and gradually large areas are being liberated and reclaimed. If, however, the request of General Thimmaya is acceded to and some more troops are loaned to him, we may in the very near future find ourselves in the occupation of Muzzafarabad and a substantial part of Poonch Jagir. "Our troops have fortunately for us created a very good impression on the whole and are generally popular with the civilian population. But there is a peculiar feeling gradually creeping in the minds of our soldiers and the officers and whenever I had an occasion to visit them at the fronts, they have spoken to me freely and frankly hoping that their feeling would be communicated to the Government. They feel that our Government is not taking the matter of Kashmir very seriously and are not fighting the war as it should be. The Government, according to them, is anxious to avoid getting casualties and is therefore asking the Commanders to be deliberately cautious. The war therefore promises to be long drawn and that has created a sense of frustration in our troops. They are anxious to fight and are hopeful that if the Government gives them permission to go ahead and finish the job, they would be able to do so. There are bound to be casualties for which the Government should be prepared, but being superior in arms and training, they are hopeful about the outcome. "Another important factor which they want the Government to bear in mind is that between the Indian troops and the regular Pakistan Army are interposed large numbers of tribal hordes. The Pakistan Army have orders not to come into actual combat with the Indian Army and to withdraw tactically the moment they feel that the tribal ranks between them and the Indian Army is cracking up. The anxiety of the Pakistan Government obviously seems to be to avoid coming out into open conflict with the Indian Army and thereby also avoid detection. This weakness of the Pakistan Government's position should be taken advantage of and our troops should be ordered to go ahead. Still another worry is the UN Commission. Our officers and soldiers have in one voice expressed strong disapproval of the Government's policy offering plebiscite as the final solution of the Kashmir problem. The offer of a plebiscite, according to them, should be withdrawn now that the regular Pakistan troops are fighting in Kashmir. And then, the outcome of a plebiscite seems to them to be very doubtful and so they ask, perhaps rightly too, if it is worth fighting for a territory like Poonch where the outcome of a plebiscite could even be predicted. "Our troops have advanced into positions near Chakoti, wherefore they must either go ahead or retreat back to Uri. They are at present on the hills on both sides of the river and so are the raiders. Once they chase the enemy from these hills and come down to Chenari, they have a clear road open to them. It is therefore necessary for the Army Command to go ahead with forward planning, but they would feel greatly relieved and doubly hopeful if they were assured that the UN Commission's intervention would not bring about a ceasefire order, in the midst of offensive operations," Kachru said in the letter. It would be safe to assume that Nehru was fully apprised of the military situation on the ground in Kashmir. It is also clear that things were going well and Indian troops were poised to strike deeper and further in reclaiming parts lost in the immediate aftermath of the tribal incursion as they evicted the squatters successfully. But with Nehru listening to Mountbatten and agreeing to internationalise the issue by taking it to the UN, the Prime Minister appeared hesitant to move forward more aggressively militarily despite repeated reminders and exhortations from Kachru.  It is clear that things were going well and Indian troops were poised to strike deeper and further in reclaiming parts lost in the immediate aftermath of the tribal incursion. But with Nehru listening to Mountbatten and agreeing to internationalise the issue by taking it to the UN, the Prime Minister appeared hesitant to move forward more aggressively militarily despite repeated reminders and exhortations from Kachru.  The dispatches from the war zone were frequent. In yet another note dated 17 June 1948, Kachru visited Tragbal along with Gen. Thimmaya and deputy CM Bakshi. "The general, in his short exposition recorded in Tragbal, informed those gathered that he had swept the whole of Handwara area including the whole of Karna Tehsil which included the recently liberated areas of Titwal and Karen. He hoped to liberate the entire area of every raider by the end of this month and then launch his offensive towards Gurez. At the foot of Tragbal rested the Wular Lake and it was one of the most beautiful spots in Kashmir. From Targbal, it is 16 miles to Gurez, the immediate objective of our Army. We have actually gone to a point over 7 miles from Tragbal and the remaining 15 or 16 miles to Gurez may, we hope, be conquered in a couple of weeks. "Gurez is an important town of very great importance both from the strategic and political viewpoint. Gurez is 155 miles from Gilgit and its recapture will open the road to Gilgit to our troops. Gurez at present is also the main supply base for the raiders operating in the frontier illaqas of Kargil, Ladakh and Skardu and is connected by a direct diagonal route to Drass, another important stop on the Srinagar-Ladakh road. Gurez in the hands of the raiders is therefore a great menace to us and its recapture will deal a death-blow to the designs of Pakistan in the Sind Valley. The capture of Gurez should synchronise with the capture of Drass for then alone the Pakistani hordes will be trapped between these two points," he wrote. On 13 April 1948, this missive was sent to the Prime Minister. Again it showed how the battle was raging: "With the onset of summer, military operations on both sides are assuming importance. In the Jammu province, the fall of Jhangar a few weeks ago, followed by a vigorous drive towards the adjoining area and particularly towards the town of Rajouri captured by the raiders in November last. Our troops entered Rajouri yesterday afternoon and the raiders ran away leaving the town looted, burnt and pillaged. The rejoicing of the people of Rajouri at the sight of Indian Army was reminiscent of the celebrations which took place in Baramulla when it was captured by us. "The recapture of Rajouri has a great significance as it relieves the pressure on Shopian, a town 35 miles south of Srinagar and on Ramban, a small station on the Jammu-Srinagar road. It also cuts off one of the supply lines of the raiders operating in the areas of Mirpur and Poonch. In Kashmir Valley, the battle on the Uri front has again flared up into a large-scale engagement and for the last one week fighting is going on in various pockets in Mahura and Uri. "The situation on the Skardu front is, however, somewhat confusing and has to be tackled immediately. The Skardu garrison is holding on to the Fort in the town but it is practically cut off from the areas surrounding it. The pickets which, were sent out are mostly missing and one or two of them have with great difficulty been able to make occasional contact with the Fort. The relieving columns sent from Srinagar have not reached yet and are still five stations from Skardu town. In the meantime the garrison is running short of supplies. Brigadier Fakir Singh, a senior officer of the Kashmir State Forces which was sent to Skardu sometime back, ran away from there leaving behind 65,000 rounds of ammo and large quantities of mortars, hand grenades and rifles. All this has fallen into the hands of the enemy. "I discussed the Skardu situation with Gen Cariappa and Gen Kalwant Singh. They were of the opinion that air operations must be carried out in Skardu when and if necessary. This to me is a serious handicap for an Army Commander charged with the responsibility of fighting a war. The operation in Skardu particularly must to a great extent be carried on from the air. The road to the area is long and hazardous and even civil supplies may have to be carried by air. Under the existing arrangement there is great deal of coordination between the Army and the Air Force and generally air action is carried out at the request of the Army Commander. But in a war the Commander who has overall charge of the entire operation can function much more effectively and quickly if he could exercise some control over the air arm and have assistance of the Air Force at his disposal whenever he wanted it." There were other ticklish issues concerning the Army that were flagged by 'eyes and ears' Kachru for the PM, that a mini mutiny was brewing right at the top: "I had also occasion to spend some time with our Army Commanders, particularly Generals Kalwant Singh and Lakhindra Singh. Gen Kalwant Singh seems to have taken his transfer from the Kashmir operations very seriously. He had a long talk with me and he said that in case he was transferred, many other senior officers would also not like to serve in Kashmir. He named Gen Lakhindra Singh and Brig Usman who, he said, would never like to work under Gen Thimmaya. He suspected an Army clique against him at the HQ in Delhi and was visibly moved when he told me that the post of the chief of general staff, which was his permanent job, would also not be given to him immediately. He was, he said, going to be sent overseas on a purchasing mission and pending the receipt of orders in this behalf, he was asked to go on leave. "It is difficult for me to judge the decisions taken at the Army HQ but one thing is clear that the sudden and complete exit of Kalwant Singh from the picture of Kashmir operations would perhaps not be very desirable. To start with, the Pakistan and Azad Kashmir governments would try and make capital out of this change. Secondly, it would lower the prestige of the Army Commanders in the eyes of the public and thirdly, it would accentuate the differences and widen the rift among the Army generals at a time when they should all be united in a common endeavour. Gen Thimmaya who is succeeding Gen Kalwant Singh would no doubt be a very successful Army Commander in the Kashmir theatre." Probably the most significant dispatch from Kachru came on 3 April 1948, marked secret and personal to Prime Minister Nehru. This was a gist of his conversations in Delhi with the army chiefs involved in Kashmir operations: "Gen Cariappa with whom I spent a couple of hours on the night of March 29 talked at length about Kashmir operations and the consequences arising out of our actions. He was quite hopeful that ultimately we would succeed in driving out the raiders from the State, but he was rather worried about the long borderline between Kashmir and Pakistan and about the situation in Gilgit and Skardu. He was of the opinion and-and in this he was supported by the C-in-C also-that we should withdraw on the Gilgit and Skardu fronts and take up our positions at Kargil. In other words, he thinks we should give up Gilgit and Skardu and hold onto Ladakh which is easy to keep and defend. He had during his recent visit to Kashmir gone to Handwara and Uri and also spoken to the peasants and locals there. He was moved by the effect of the salt scarcity on the civilian population and he himself distributed small packets of salt. He discovered that the masses on the whole were fond of Sheikh Saheb and referred to him with great respect. He was impressed with the morale of the people in Srinagar and other towns. Gen Sir Roy Bucher, C-in-C, elaborated on the inadvisability of resorting to excessive air bombing. This he felt would needlessly destroy property, stiffen the resistance against us and at places increase the volume of opposition." This eye-opening content reveals for the first time how Nehru's idealism and stodgy belief in rule of law stood in the way of the Indian Army reclaiming PoK, and perhaps right there and then, cauterising the putrefied sore of Kashmir. The map of Jammu & Kashmir may well have looked different had Kachru's advice to Nehru been heeded.  (This is part of the overarching research done by the writer for the third part of his Kashmir triology - Bedevilled Kashmir - for Harper Collins, some of this was done while he was at think tank ORF)   @sandeep_bamzai  Dailyhunt	|Friday, 18 Aug, 10.47 am

Even though the manufacturer is present in the sub-4 meter and D-Segment sedan in India, but there's a big gap in the line-up. To fill the void, Toyota announced that they will launch the mid-size sedan, the Yaris. The upcoming Yaris has been long awaited in the Indian market. It will take on the rivals like Honda City, Maruti Ciaz and Hyundai Verna in the market. How well does it fare against them on paper? Let's find out. Which one looks better? The Yaris is smaller in dimensions when compared to the rivals. The Yaris gets a typical Toyota front with a busy design. The sleek headlamps merge into the front grille. There is a small kink in the grille that gets the Toyota logo on it. It gets a huge blacked out air dam. The Honda City, on the other hand, looks very classy. It gets a single chrome bar as the grille and sleek headlamps on either side. The City has generous use of chrome too.     The Maruti gets a multi-slat chrome grille, that looks different. It gets chunky headlamps and overall, the car has a rather simple yet captivating design. The Ciaz also gets a strong shoulder line. The Verna is the newest car among the three and it looks very fresh. The new cascade grille and sleek headlamps with LED DRLs attract a lot of eyes. The Yaris looks quite sporty among all of the mentioned cars. Even though this segment does not primarily serve the youths, having a little sportiness in design makes it look different.    The Ciaz is longest among the four and is 65mm longer than the Yaris. The City and Verna are 15mm longer. However, the Ciaz and the Yaris are widest in the segment. The Ciaz is the largest among all the four cars mentioned. The compact size of Yaris may be helpful in the city conditions. Which one offers better space?    The Toyota Yaris offers the shortest wheelbase of 2,550mm among the four while the Ciaz offers 2,650mm wheelbase, a full 100mm longer than the Yaris. Even the City and the Verna offer 50mm longer wheelbase than the Yaris. Width-wise, Ciaz and the Yaris are widest in the segment while the City is the thinnest. Yaris is also shortest of all the four vehicles and offers 1,475mm. The City offers 1,495mm, which is maximum in the segment. The Yaris will not be the most spacious vehicle in the segment. Ciaz offers acres of space in the rear seat but the Yaris will be a little cramped. Space wise, the Ciaz is the winner. Which one is better equipped?    The Toyota Yaris is coming with a long list of features in India. A few of these features will be first-in-segment. It will get 7 airbags, roof-mounted AC for front and rear passengers, proximity sensors at the front, 60:40 split seats, three neck restraints at the rear, ambient lighting, electrically powered driver seat, disc brake in all four wheels, hill start assist, ABS, EBD and ESP. The Hyundai Verna is the only vehicle in the segment to offer cooled front seats. While the Honda City gets full LED headlamps. Honda City and the Hyundai Verna are the only vehicles to offer a sunroof. Maruti Ciaz does not get anything unique except the SHVS Hybrid system that increases the fuel efficiency. What about the engines?    Toyota only revealed the details of their petrol engine that will be available with the Yaris. The diesel engine will not be offered in India. That being said, all the other rivals offer both petrol and diesel engine options. The Yaris will be powered by a 1.4-litre petrol engine that generates a maximum of 88 Bhp and peak torque of 205 Nm. It is not the most powerful engine in the segment but it gets a 6-speed manual transmission and a 7-step CVT automatic. The Honda City is powered by a 1.5-litre petrol engine that generates 119 Bhp and 145 Nm torque. It gets a 5-speed manual and 7-step CVT. The Hyundai Verna is the most powerful among the four. It gets 1.6-litre petrol engine that generates 123 Bhp and 151 Nm. There's a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Ciaz petrol is a 1.4-litre unit that generates a maximum of 92 Bhp and 130 Nm. It gets a 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmission. Even though the Yaris will not get a diesel engine, all the competitors offer that. The Ciaz is powered by a 1.3-litre engine that produces 89 Bhp - 200 Nm. It gets Smart Hybrid Vehicle by Suzuki (SHVS), which increases the mileage. It is the most fuel-efficient sedan in the segment. The Honda City is powered by the 1.5-litre Earth Dreams engine that churns out a maximum of 99 Bhp and 200 Nm. The Verna is again, the most powerful among the three. It gets a 1.6-litre diesel engine that generates a maximum of 126 Bhp - 260 Nm. Dailyhunt	|Monday, 05 Mar, 7.25 pm4 days ago7 days ago2 weeks ago4 days ago3 days ago

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/what+it+means+if+a+lizard+falls+on+you-newsid-71506616| Home What it means if a lizard falls on you? | Ideally, you scream at the top of your lungs and run for your life. It is only later that the gravity of the situation dawns on you and you feel creepy all over. For those of you who fear lizards, our sympathies. In fact, there are people who will not venture into a room if they see a lizard in it (raises hand in admission). Though they are harmless (I find that difficult to believe) household pests, they have a lot of bad press attached to them. Also, they make good subject for superstitions as well. Apparently, if the poor lizard happens to fall on you it's trying to tell you something (how about the lizard just lost its balance?). Did you know a lizard falling on certain body parts mean certain things? It only goes to show these reptiles are not very good with staying on the ceilings.  Heck, whatever a lizard does has some meaning!  Scouring through the database of all things weird this is what we came up with  #The study of falling of lizards is called Gauli shastra. According to this shastra, every movement of a lizard holds significance and there are not less than 65 places where the lizard will fall on the human body that would foretell good and bad omens. #If you happen to see two lizards mating it means you are going to meet an old friend, if you seem them quarrelling you will also pick fight with someone. #If you see a dead lizard while moving into a new house, it could mean bad luck and illness for your family. On the contrary, some people believe seeing a lizard in the new house means Goddess Lakshmi is visiting them. #The lizard must know on which side to fall: Lizard falling on your right arm means elevation in society or a sensual adventure ahead and on your left arm means you are going to lose money. It is considered auspicious if the lizard falls on the right body parts of man and left body parts in women. For both it means different things. #The most common one, in the north if a lizard falls on your head it means good luck and if it falls on your forehead it means you will have a disease while some say it brings wealth. In the south people believe that if a lizard falls on the head then it means ill luck and in some cases even death. For example there is a story that a lizard fell on Chief Minister Biju Patnaik, just before elections in 2009, and he came back to power.​ #The lizard on the right and left shoulders mean victory and peace and happiness respectively. #If the thing decides to take a tour of your body, well, it seems it is wishing you a long life. #It is difficult to term what noise a lizard makes- is it twittering, is it chirping, or is it clucking? Anyway, so what does it mean when you hear a lizard's call? I would say it's just conversing with its mates but then humans also have an explanation for that as well. In Malayalam movies at least, if a lizard calls when you are saying something then it means that you are telling the truth and that is bound to happen. #To wash off all the ill luck that comes from touching a lizard or it falling on a person, one needs to visit Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram, where one can touch the golden Lizard, the silver lizard along with the sun and moon images on the roof, behind the sanctum sanctorum. When one touches them it is believed to remove all ill-effects or doshas caused due to the falling of lizards in the past and in future.  While we do not endorse any of these and do not wish lizards to fall on you, there are actually mentions of the lizard and its calls and more on its significance in Hinduism, Vedas and South Indian holy scriptures.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/shocking+your+favourite+idli+can+cause+cancer-newsid-69060145| Home Shocking: Your favourite idli can cause cancer | The researchers and environmentalists argue that the idlis prepared using plastic covers instead of cotton cloth while baking is the potential threat to human life as plastic emits harmful microns in heat. This micron, when makes an entry into the human system, can cause cancer.Professor and Head of The Department Chemistry, CMR Institute of Technology, Dr Phani Kumar Pullela said, the new journal of medicine has already made publications of the harmful impact of plastic coming into contact with humans.Food and beverage containers, some disposable plates, and toiletry bottles made of plastic have chemicals. Research suggests that all plastics may release chemicals if they're scratched or heated. Research also strongly suggests that at certain exposure levels, some of the chemicals in these products, such as Bisphenol A (BPA), may cause cancer in people. "The same concept has to be applied in cooking idli. If the idli is cooked using thin plastic, there is a high chance of suffering from diseases including cancer. The plastic residues may leak into food substance when exposed to heat. The plastic emits harmful carcinogens when food is cooked or is heated in plastic items. In the long run, people will get infected with cancer as well," said Dr Pulella.Agreeing with Dr Pullela, Dr Linge Gowda, Director of KIDWAI Memorial Institute of Oncology, says, it is beyond an iota of doubt that plastic when exposed to heat releases harmful carcinogens which cause cancer."Consumption of food cooked in aluminium, steel, earthen pot or copper is safe. We have noticed people using plastic glass to drink roadside tea, and also people eat food like idli cooked using a plastic sheet in the cookware. The hotels and roadside stalls were earlier using a cotton cloth to avoid batter getting struck to idly cooking plates, but now, the plastic sheet is being used in most of the eateries. In the long run, this will have an impact on health. Hence we suggest that the local and municipal authorities must impose penalty on such eateries," he said. Dr Nirmal Buggi, Chief Health Officer of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, has directed all the 198 health inspectors to check eateries in their respective jurisdiction and impose penalty for use of plastic in cooking. "The plastic above 40 micron and micro wave safe vessels are only allowed to cook and serve food when it comes to use of plastic. The roadside shops are aware that using such plastic in cooking and also while covering the serving plate can cause negative effects on health. Yet, they do not comply with BBMP rules," he said.

IPL 2018 Fever: What Other Telcos Are Offering Not just Reliance Jio, other telcos like Airtel and BSNL are offering exclusive IPL 2018 packs and services. The next two months will see telcos trying to win over each other in the battle of grabbing the attention of around 700 million sports fans in India who are expected to stay glued to the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018. The main objective of companies will be to fetch heavy data users during the season as they watch the livestreaming of these matches on their smartphones. This way, the companies will be able to push average revenue per user (ARPU) in two months. While BSNL's special IPL recharge pack that offers 3GB data per day is limited to 3G speeds, Airtel took a different route by partnering with Hotstar to provide its subscribers with live streaming of matches and highlights on the Airtel TV app. Interestingly, Airtel has also started offering MIMO Pre-5G services at IPL 2018 venues for its users. The first venue to get the service is Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The battle is not just limited to sports, in the past few months we have witnessed telcos in India trying out different means to push users towards greater data consumption. For example, Airtel has started offering free Amazon Prime subscription to the users who recharge for more than a specific amount. Similarly, Vodafone India is offering free Netflix subscription to its users while Idea Cellular has tied with Indian content providers like Eros, ALT Balaji (also on Airtel TV app) and Sony Music. And as for Jio, it has got some original content, thanks to Reliance's ownership of the Network 18 group. Dailyhunt	|Friday, 13 Apr, 5.31 ama week ago2 weeks agoa week ago2 days ago3 days ago

Police suspected that more than one person were involved in the gruesome murder case. The body was sent for the autopsy to ascertain the cause of death of the youth after recovering it from Kuakhai Riverbed on March 21.

This time the sex video of a winner of a reality show has gone viral on social media. The reality show was aired in one of the Odia channels. The 1.7 minute intimate video of reality show winner has gone viral. However, the girl, who was the winner of a reality show in 2016 is yet to file a police complaint in this regard. The girl is a student of Journalism and Mass Communication. Numerous such videos have surfaced in the social media and many accused have been nabbed by the police. Even though the state police had issued an advisory on obscene viral videos, it seems the advisory has less impact on the youth mass who make their sex videos viral on social networking sites.

https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/what+it+means+if+a+lizard+falls+on+you-newsid-71506616| Home What it means if a lizard falls on you? | Ideally, you scream at the top of your lungs and run for your life. It is only later that the gravity of the situation dawns on you and you feel creepy all over. For those of you who fear lizards, our sympathies. In fact, there are people who will not venture into a room if they see a lizard in it (raises hand in admission). Though they are harmless (I find that difficult to believe) household pests, they have a lot of bad press attached to them. Also, they make good subject for superstitions as well. Apparently, if the poor lizard happens to fall on you it's trying to tell you something (how about the lizard just lost its balance?). Did you know a lizard falling on certain body parts mean certain things? It only goes to show these reptiles are not very good with staying on the ceilings.  Heck, whatever a lizard does has some meaning!  Scouring through the database of all things weird this is what we came up with  #The study of falling of lizards is called Gauli shastra. According to this shastra, every movement of a lizard holds significance and there are not less than 65 places where the lizard will fall on the human body that would foretell good and bad omens. #If you happen to see two lizards mating it means you are going to meet an old friend, if you seem them quarrelling you will also pick fight with someone. #If you see a dead lizard while moving into a new house, it could mean bad luck and illness for your family. On the contrary, some people believe seeing a lizard in the new house means Goddess Lakshmi is visiting them. #The lizard must know on which side to fall: Lizard falling on your right arm means elevation in society or a sensual adventure ahead and on your left arm means you are going to lose money. It is considered auspicious if the lizard falls on the right body parts of man and left body parts in women. For both it means different things. #The most common one, in the north if a lizard falls on your head it means good luck and if it falls on your forehead it means you will have a disease while some say it brings wealth. In the south people believe that if a lizard falls on the head then it means ill luck and in some cases even death. For example there is a story that a lizard fell on Chief Minister Biju Patnaik, just before elections in 2009, and he came back to power.​ #The lizard on the right and left shoulders mean victory and peace and happiness respectively. #If the thing decides to take a tour of your body, well, it seems it is wishing you a long life. #It is difficult to term what noise a lizard makes- is it twittering, is it chirping, or is it clucking? Anyway, so what does it mean when you hear a lizard's call? I would say it's just conversing with its mates but then humans also have an explanation for that as well. In Malayalam movies at least, if a lizard calls when you are saying something then it means that you are telling the truth and that is bound to happen. #To wash off all the ill luck that comes from touching a lizard or it falling on a person, one needs to visit Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram, where one can touch the golden Lizard, the silver lizard along with the sun and moon images on the roof, behind the sanctum sanctorum. When one touches them it is believed to remove all ill-effects or doshas caused due to the falling of lizards in the past and in future.  While we do not endorse any of these and do not wish lizards to fall on you, there are actually mentions of the lizard and its calls and more on its significance in Hinduism, Vedas and South Indian holy scriptures.
