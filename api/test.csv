"New Delhi: The government is expecting a challenge in rolling out the National Health Protection Mission (NHPM) to the urban poor after completing the first round of data cleansing earlier this month.Billed as the world's largest health assurance scheme, NHPM, dubbed Modicare, aims to provide free health insurance of Rs5 lakh per family to nearly 40% of the population-more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families based on Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC).The health ministry is currently detecting, correcting and deleting inaccurate records from its database for targeted beneficiaries.While contacting rural beneficiaries to inform them about their entitlement for NHPS has been strategically planned, the major task for the government now is finding the actual whereabouts of urban beneficiaries. ""The NHPM is an entitlement-based scheme and the biggest challenge is to reach out to poor and tell them that they are entitled for this scheme,"" said Dinesh Arora, director, Ayushman Bharat-NHPM. In rural areas, the government has drafted in the rural development ministry and gram panchayats. The gram panchayats will hold Ayushman Diwas on 30 April and read out the list of beneficiaries. In urban areas, however, the government has involved civic authorities. The uneven geographic distribution of poor families may make it difficult for government to find out the real targeted beneficiaries of Modicare. ""The NHPM has included people on the criteria of profession. The urban space is geographically diffused and the poor population in urban areas is fluid. The population keeps on coming in, going out and migrating within as well as outside the urban space,"" said Vinod Kumar Paul, member (health and nutrition), NITI Aayog. Paul is involved in charting out the plans for Modicare.""There may come some inherent difficulties in communicating with this chunk of urban population. As this is a national scheme and has to be implemented in partnership with the states, they will have to find out ways to reach out to the lowest quintile of their areas,"" he said.The different categories in rural area include families having only one room with kutcha walls and kutcha roof; families having no adult member between age 16 to 59; female headed households with no adult male member between age 16 to 59; disabled member and no able bodied adult member in the family; SC/ST households; and landless households deriving major part of their income from manual casual labour. Also, automatically included are families in rural areas having any one of the following attributes-households without shelter; destitute; living on alms; manual scavenger families; primitive tribal groups; and legally released bonded labour. For urban areas, 11 defined occupational categories, including ragpickers, beggars, domestic workers, cobblers, hawkers, construction workers, plumbers, painters and security guards, are entitled under the scheme. ""In rural areas, most of the panchayats have updated data but in urban areas, family numbers keep on changing as urban India has mobile and migratory population. We are verifying the data, which is quite challenging in urban areas as there are unauthorized colonies, jhuggi jhopdi clusters that have potential beneficiaries of NHPM,"" said Alok Saxena, joint secretary, Union health ministry.""We are trying to loop in nodal agencies and NGOs so that we can reach targeted beneficiaries. We will send letters to these people. They can also collect their entitlement letters from the post offices,"" he said.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Modicare faces challenges in reaching out to urban poor ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/live+mint-epaper-livemint/modicare+faces+challenges+in+reaching+out+to+urban+poor-newsid-85794318

"  India is considered to have one of the World's oldest and the most diverse cultures. India's languages, religions, dance, and customs differ from place to place within the country and have a respect for each other. After 100 years of slavery, India got independent and since then it didn't look back in the development. It has the fastest growing economy and has a reputed place in the world. We are a part of this great country yet, there are some issues or taboo from which we need to go through and have to respect that.  India, known to be one of the largest democracies in the world has the largest bunch of hypocrites.The hypocrisy is more gender-oriented here than an individual oriented. How can we forget about the important decision by the SC bench in the year 2010 that spoke in favour of live-in-relationships and pre-marital sex? There is no law that considers these two acts of adults as an offence. Lord Krishna was worshipped and respected although he lived with Radha with no formal recognition of the relationship in the society.  Sex before marriage is one of the concerns and Indian society doesn't allow having sex before your marriage. It is matched with the character of a girl who has no dignified character and she is looked down upon. In our country, if a girl loses her virginity before marriage, she will be framed as 'slut', which is used to describe the character of a girl and I don't need to describe the meaning of slut. The height of hypocrisy is seen when, still, in certain parts of our country, on the first night of the wedding, a newly wedded girl's chastity is tested on a white bedsheet. I am sure you know what I mean.     It has been in the society for years and it has been followed even by most educated families too. It is not about the freedom and choice of a girl but it looked like cheating your future husband. It is especially categorised to girls but has no such ritual for boys. Every boy who is ready for a marriage wants a virgin girl but not compared to with how many girls he slept in the past. It is a taboo for a girl but not for a boy as he can lose his virginity. The society doesn't question as men are privileged to make choices.  Sex education is as important as any other subject but still, it is not regular academics in any school. The problem is we as Indians have a problem with the word 'sex'. Whenever we hear this word, it makes us conscious and we don't want to be a part of that conversation. This is how things work in our country. Instead of being a part of the conversation, we rather prefer to talk about it in the selected group of people and even make of it.  Sex education has been pointed out by many Bollywood movies - a few in a subtle way while a few in the most candid way. We loved the movies "" Piku "" and ""Pink"" but let's come to the point. Can we expect all dads of the society to be as liberal as Amitabh Bachchan in Piku who indicated to his daughter's 'prospected' boyfriend that she was not a virgin?  Pink was a film that devastated the whole concept of choice by women versus choice by men. We accept and learn the lessons from movies but fail to apply that in our day to day lives.  As a girl, if you bring a guy friend to your house, they will ask about the relationship status or how serious is the relationship and the best question just comes after that, did you think about marrying the same guy? Everybody has the freedom to choose or to have sex with and it should not be limited to your future husband even if you will marry someone or not. It depends on the upbringing of the child and women having sex before marriage is definitely still a taboo among many Indians.  It also depends on where you live, what your religious beliefs are and what you personally believe. There are many western countries where people generally lose their virginity at the age of 15-17 and in India, stats are changing as more than 50 per cent of Indian population are below 25 and 49 per cent of them are in a relationship. So before getting married, they are maintaining a relationship and it is obvious that they had or will have some moments. Things are changing and we as a part of this country should reconsider or thoughts. It is still a taboo for girls and if it is then it should be for boys as well. It is not about losing your virginity but it is about finding the right person.  I condemn the act of hypocrisy and orthodoxy around pre-marital sex. A woman can go through marital rape but can't be made love to before marriage. A man wants to marry a virgin although he has never had that record of the same.  How do we know that a woman who had never had sex before marriage is a human being with a heart of gold? Sex is a choice and should be left to be chosen by adults. Like the menstruation and nightfall in women and men the urge to have sex is normal. Why suppress one and be tagged with names that no parents would like to call their children. © 2015 DailyHunt ",Sex before marriage is a taboo in India.

"At a time a BJP MLA is in the dock over allegations of rape and subsequent cover-up efforts, an analysis showed that 1% of around 4,900 current MPs and MLAs in the country face charges of crime against women.The BJP leads the pack with 12 or one-fourth of its 48 lawmakers -- 45 MLAs and 3 MPs -- who face such cases. Of these 48 lawmakers, three MLAs are booked under sections related to rape.The three MLAs with rape cases against them are G Suryanarayana (TDP - Andhra Pradesh), Jethabhai G Ahir (BJP - Gujarat) and Gulab Yadav (RJD - Bihar).According to the analysis of self-sworn affidavits of 4,845 out of a total of 4,896 MPs and MLAs by private election watchdog Association for Democratic Rights, recognised parties have given tickets to 26 candidates, who had declared cases related to rape in the last five years.Fourteen independent candidates with such charges have contested in Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha and State Assembly polls during the same period. If BJP tops the list, Shiv Sena has seven lawmakers who have cases of crime against women against them. Trinamool Congress has six such lawmakers followed by TDP (5), Congress (4) and BJD (4). When it comes to states, Maharashtra has the highest number of 12 such MPs and MLAs followed by West Bengal (11), Odisha (5) and Andhra Pradesh (5).Recognised parties have fielded 327 candidates with various charges of crime against women in past five years. Of this, 40 candidates were given tickets by parties for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha elections. Among major parties, BJP gave tickets to 47 such candidates followed by BSP (35) and Congress (24).Debar accusedThe analysis comes at a time the country is outraged over rape incidents in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua where an eight-year-old nomad girl was the victim and in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao where BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is arrested. The Unnao case hit headlines after the victim attempted self-immolation near UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence and her father died in police custody.The ADR has demanded that the candidates with a serious criminal background should be debarred from contesting elections.

"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday welcomed the Supreme Court's verdict turning down the pleas to probe the death of special CBI judge B H Loya and mounted attack on Congress President Rahul Gandhi.""Rahul does not want any person other than someone from the Gandhi family run the country. The Congress stands exposed,"" he tweeted.Referring to Congress press conferences and a Rahul Gandhi-led delegation to the President for a probe into Judge Loya's death, the chief minister said the apex court verdict on the issue has exposed the ""ugly face"" of the Congress.Talking to reporters later, he said, ""The verdict in Judge Loya case has exposed the Congress once again. Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the people of the country. They have tried to create such an environment that develops negative emotions in the people for the government.""The Supreme Court today ruled that Judge Loya died of natural causes and that the petitions were serious attempts to scandalise and obstruct the course of justice.Loya had allegedly died of cardiac arrest in Nagpur on December 1, 2014 when he had gone to attend the wedding of a colleague's daughter.The top court, which was critical of the petitioners and their lawyers for making insinuations against judicial officers and judges, said an attempt was made to cause prejudice against them and it was a ""vituperative assault on the judiciary.""It said with these petitions it has become clear that ""a real attempt and frontal attack"" was made on the independence of judiciary and the present case was a manifestation to carry forward a personal agenda.

" ""It is tough to stand up for what is right, especially when there is resistance from all sides. We should not feel that nothing is in my hands. If an officer feels like that, what will the common man do?""  - IAS Rohini Sindhuri Dasari  Whether it was locking down the office of A Manju, the Minister-in-charge of the Hassan district, or raising a voice against her untimely and abrupt transfer, firebrand IAS officer, Rohini Sindhuri, isn't afraid of authority.Time and again, this gutsy officer has made headlines not only for running successful campaigns in the districts she was posted to but also for standing strong as a gritty and determined role model who refuses to bow down under political pressure.As the CEO of Mandya Zilla Parishad, Rohini successfully launched a drive to provide individual toilets to over 1.02 lakh households between 2014-15.She managed to construct over 80,000 individual toilets across the district, which helped it clinch the number one position in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in the state and rank third in the entire country.Rohini was also lauded for successfully utilising the Central government's grant of Rs 65 crore for drinking water. Alongside her team, she instituted over a 100 pure drinking water units across the district. Her work impressed the Union government yet again and earned the district an additional grant of 6 crores to widen the reach.One of her popular strategies to help people in the Mandya ZP inculcate good sanitation measures was the Munjaane programme, where Rohini would personally meet the villagers early morning and promote the cause of constructing individual toilets.She was also praised by the CM Siddaramaiah at a meeting of Deputy Commissioners and Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive officers for executing a crop survey in connection with farmers' crop insurance scheme in November 2017.However, just like many honest IAS officers, her journey to success has been anything, but easy.As the District Election Officer, Rohini recently made headlines, when she locked down A Manju's office in the PWD Inspection Bungalow. He is the Minister-in-charge of Hassan district and the office was reportedly locked from outside while some staff members continued to clear pending files inside.Rohini issued notices to the minister as well as the PWD Department for using government space for election work which is a violation of the Model Code of Conduct and is effective from the declaration of poll dates.Needless to say, her clashes with political personalities are being termed one of the reasons for her abrupt transfer. That being said and done, the IAS officer isn't giving up. She is fighting for her right to stay and continue the work she painstakingly started in the district.  Rohini challenged the state government's decision to transfer her in January merely eight months after she was appointed as the Deputy Commissioner of the Hassan district. She appealed to the Karnataka High Court and the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) for the same.After the Election Commission requested the state government to postpone her transfer until the final publication of electoral rolls, her transfer order was withdrawn on March 5. However, it only took 48 hours for the same transfer order to be re-issued.The HC recently directed the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Bengaluru, to examine the application Rohini filed against her transfer after it was brought to their notice that despite asking her to submit a representation to the chief secretary, the CAT did not take any decision on it. And her battle continues.In an interview with the Bangalore Mirror, Rohini recollected a similar instance in the past where she was abruptly transferred from Mandya, and said-""I was doing very well, and it was just one year, three months and some random guy was complaining about something. When they can't find anything, they'll say 'Gaurava Kotilla' [did not get respect]. What does it even mean?.We are here to solve people's issues. We were supposed to declare the district Open Defecation Free, and I had only requested for two to three months so that I could finish the work. But they wanted to know what my interest was in staying.""She expressed the challenges IAS officers face when they get posted to a district and are transferred prematurely saying, ""By the time you put an administration in place, form a team and start working, you are asked to leave.

" Tulsi is an adaptogen with innumerable benefits. But it has some side effects too. It may temporarily lower fertility in men and women and is not recommended during pregnancy. It may also add to the effects of blood thinning and antidiabetic mediation and stain your teeth if chewed rather than swallowed. ""Elixir of life,"" ""liquid yoga,"" ""Ayurveda's golden remedy"" .. tulsi or holy basil has some solid credentials thanks to its wide-ranging health benefits. The tulsi or holy basil plant is almost ubiquitous in Indian homes, revered in many Indian cultures, and generally has a good safety profile. But for all its goodness, it may be still out of bounds for some of us. Here are some potential side effects or health implications you should be aware of.Tulsi has been seen to have a negative effect on fertility in both genders. While this isn't established yet in human studies and may apply to larger quantities in excess of dietary intake, there's reason enough to play it safe if you are planning a family. Animal studies show that tulsi may lower sperm count and motility. It has also been found to decrease the weight of organs such as the testes, prostate, and adrenal glands which play a role in male reproductive health.1 . There have also been reports about its ability to bring about changes in female reproductive organs such as the uterus and ovary.2 The antifertility effect of tulsi is thought to stem from its ability to modulate reproductive hormones. In fact, researchers are even studying its potential as a contraceptive agent.3 These antifertility effects may be reversible, though, and may not cause permanent damage - one animal study found that they were reversed a month after the test animals stopped feeding on tulsi leaves.4 A compound present in tulsi leaves known as estragol may cause uterine contractions. Therefore, it may be best to avoid this herb during pregnancy.5 Tulsi works as a blood thinner but this doesn't typically cause harm. If you are, however, already on blood thinning medication, it can enhance its effects and cause problems with blood clotting. If you take blood thinners, do check in with your doctor before using tulsi. 6 Various studies have found that tulsi can lower blood sugar. And if you take medication to control your blood sugar, it may enhance this effect and even cause levels to fall too low. Again, speak to your doctor before consuming tulsi if you are on medicines for diabetes.7 Traditionally, in many Asian communities, tulsi leaves are supposed to be swallowed rather than chewed. They are considered sacred and chewing them is thought to be disrespectful. But there might be a scientific rationale for this too. Tulsi leaves contain iron and may, therefore, stain your teeth when chewed.8 This may not really affect your dental health but can cause discoloration. Instead of chewing them, you can simply gulp them down with some water.9 © 2015 DailyHunt ",5 Side Effects Of Tulsi Or Holy Basil You Need To Know ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/curejoy-epaper-curejoy/5+side+effects+of+tulsi+or+holy+basil+you+need+to+know-newsid-82732590
"  Speaking to Republic TV's editorial advisor Chitra Subramaniam, Lindström revealed that all pay-off connected to the Bofors deal was planned by late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.Lindström now 71, was the whistleblower, who leaked over 300 documents including details of payment instructions to banks and a diary Bofors Managing Director Martin Ardbo that contained several sensitive information.The former Swedish police revealed that in 1986, on a flight from India, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had suggested that Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme should also receive funds from Bofors for his own purposes. And it was after this conversation, 50 million Swedish Krona was shifted to a foundation, and 30 million of this was used for the economic development of a region in Sweden. Bofors chief investigating officer Sten Lindstrom makes sensational claim. Watch him speak LIVE with Arnab up next. #RepublicExposesBofors pic.twitter.com/DSNCFxKQea   Here are the people being spoken of:Olof Palme - Prime Minister of Sweden Rajiv Gandhi - Prime Minister of India Martin Ardbo - Former Bofors chief and point person for Bofors' India contract Sten Lindstrom - Chief investigator  The conversation:    Yes. They said that he [Martin Ardbo] had been on a flight from India in early night in 1986 and in that flight, Olof Palme and PM Rajiv Gandhi had been as well and they had discussed payments because Rajiv Gandhi wanted Mr. Olof to receive funds for Bofors for purpose of his own. Whatever (purpose). Mr. Olof suggested that if that was necessary, some funds would go to funds in Bofors' name foundation, for development of industry and employment in the name of Bergslagsfonden  That is very interesting. You are saying that the suggestion to take some money from Bofors for Sweden or the party came from Rajiv Gandhi?  Not to take it...it was suggested from him that Mr Palme would receive money for some purpose of his own. Whatever (purpose). And it was decided that 50 million Swedish Krona would go to this fund.I don't exactly know if it...you know there have been funds before. Bofors had a foundation for development of the industry in the region. But they created a new foundation for this money from Bofors. That was connected to the sale of the guns to India. You understand? Well this is quite big, you know on this story Mr Lindstrom there has always been a suspicion that where some money is being paid back to Sweden and this is the first time that...what you're saying makes that link. It's never been made before   No it hasn't been made, but as you say, the suspicion.as in some way was done.this might be the explanation then.  So you then visited Orebro [location in Sweden] to figure out if this foundation was actually a setup and this was following a Letter Rogatory from India [issued by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government], right? Yes the purpose of the investigation was to look into how this money has been handled - who benefitted from it. And it was found that 30 million of this 50 million had been used to support some factories and workshops in the region of Bergslagen. So it was used as it was statuted in the statute of the foundation.  So this is a conversation that took place between Mr Rajiv Gandhi and Mr Olof Palme to which Martin Ardbo was a witness.  Yes  But now looking at it, it looks like a quid-pro-quo doesn't it? Like the note that you have shared says that it would make things easier for India to get some monies if some monies were also taken in Sweden.   Yes that is how it looks. Yes. © 2015 DailyHunt ",Sten Lindström interview: Bofors whistleblower exposes Rajeev Gandhi ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/sten+lindstr+m+interview+bofors+whistleblower+exposes+rajeev+gandhi-newsid-70723989

"Prostitution or sex trade is often considered as women's business. In every corner of the world, women are involved in prostitution to make a living. But it's just not the women who choose this demeaning profession to fulfil their needs, men do it too. You all may have heard about the infamous GB Road in Delhi where people avoid going in the broad daylight. But when the clock hits ten, the area gets overcrowded as people come in search of someone who can satisfy their physical needs.    But will not just find woken dressed in skimpy clothes, picking up by men in luxury cars.You will also spot plain-clothed men, who look just like women bystander on the road, await their clients. They get picked up by women who drive luxury cars. They are known as the gigolos.     From Sarojini Nagar to Lajpat Nagar and from Palika Bazaar to Kamla Nagar Market, there are many posh areas in Delhi that host 'Gigolo market' after it gets dark. Women belonging to the rich class of society come in their luxury cars and pick the men they like to spend the night with.    The majority of men, who come into the gigolo market to get picked by women, are students. It was found that boys who come here for the preparation of engineering and medical entrance exams. While some choose to become gigolos to fulfil their financial needs, some do it for fun.    The process of dealing is done in a proper systematic way. 20% of the money that male escorts get from the women has to be given to the organisation with which they are associated. This is similar to the business of prostitution where women are involved.    For the booking of gigolos, women bargain a lot. First, they pick the guy they want to have sex with and then they bargain for their charges. For spending some hours with the men, women spend Rs 1800 to 3000. If any woman wishes to spend the whole night with the man, she has to pay him Rs 8000.  The gigolos can be identified with their dressing sense. You can spot them on the GB Road and other areas, where Gigolo market is held, in black trousers and white shirt. They also put a scarf around their neck so that women can easily pick them.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Place In India Where Women Come On Streets To Buy Men For One Night Stand ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/stressbuster-epaper-strbusen/place+in+india+where+women+come+on+streets+to+buy+men+for+one+night+stand-newsid-69892234
AbRam Khan - There's a lot going in the Bollywood industry on and behind the screen which means the reel and real life.A lot of mysterious controversies every now and then keep us gossiped about the B-Town. One of the biggest news lately was the birth of Shah Rukh Khan's surrogate son AbRam Khan who is apparently his third child beside Aryan Khan and Suhana Khan.AbRam is one of the cutest star-kids in the Bollywood industry and we can't deny that. There were a lot of controversies already related to his birth which included that AbRam's biological mother was maybe Shah Rukh's cousin sister or maybe his cousin sister-in-law and a lot more.There is one more thing that has come-up from behind the scenes; though there is no proof for the same it somehow makes sense or maybe we are gossip-gobblers (kind-off).Let's leash another one related to Junior Khan's birth:There's this spark that maybe AbRam is Aryan Khan's son and not Shah Rukh Khan's. Though this seems really absurd but there's an entire story which follows. It can be explained through points in a better way so let's see how:These facts or should I rather say observation by media has definitely added fuel to fire in the case of AbRam Khan not being Shah Rukh Khan's son and rather being his grandson i.e. Aryan Khan's son.

"Over thousands of years, Hijras or the eunuchs have secretly occupied a dominant position in the society. Regardless of the fact that they have many rights in the society, they are socially not acceptable to many in our communities. For not being accepted by the society, they have created their own lifestyle and carved a space for themselves in the society.  However, they are very secretive about their lives and customs which make people want to know about their lifestyle, livelihoods, origins and traditions.Here we bring you some facts about Hijras, India's officially recognised third gender.  Emasculation operation is often termed as rebirth for Hijras, which is like their own nirvana. After operation, they become a potent eunuch from an impotent male. The emasculation operation is carried out by the midwife who performs it after receiving sanction from goddess.  Once the operation is done, they have to follow an isolation period of four days. These four days involves extra care, special diet, sufficient sleep and so on.  After the emasculation operation is done and once the four days of isolation period is over, the eunuch is made to follow a tradition.  According to this tradition, the eunuchs taken to a nearby water body for rituals, which is replica of marriage rituals in Hinduism. The eunuch becomes a potent eunuch after this tradition.  Most of their ceremonies originally have their roots in Hindu religion, but major aspects of their social structure are from Islam and the majority of their leaders and gurus are Muslims.  In 18th and 19th centuries Hindu and Muslim Hijras didn't live together, but in contemporary India they often do.  Very few people know about the death procedures of Hijras. When a eunuch dies, his death rally is carried out in the night and no one else other than their community is allowed to see the procedure.  It is believed that their funeral ceremony is sober. There are beliefs if someone else other than the Hijras sees the procedure; he is born as one in his next birth.  The dying eunuch is believed to have some divine powers, due to which eunuch would come, seek her blessings and pray for her soul.  When the other eunuchs come to know about one of their own's death, they would sit in the corner of a home and immerse themselves into prayer. Eunuchs around her pray for forgiveness so that she is born with a clear gender in next birth.  Ironically, their community is considered so bad that they turn up to places of joy, such as weddings, to take away everybody's bad luck.  They demand for cash from people and don't take no for an answer. People usually pay up quickly afraid of bad luck, obscene gestures and profane language. There is no option - it's either cash or curse.  The usual partners of Hijras are men who consider themselves heterosexual, and are the penetrative partners. These heterosexual men are mostly married and keep affairs with Hijras secret.  Even if they get married, the marriage is not considered legal in India. Hijras in India often work as sex workers and are involved in prostitution.  Every Hijras or eunuch has a guru, who is believed to be blesses with a power of knowing everything about their disciples.  It is also believed that they even have an ability to foresee their death, which is only true if he originally is born as eunuch and not undergone the emasculation. Each Hijras respect their guru a lot and follow them.  Misfortune has been a companion of India's eunuchs. Because the country has historically recognised only tow gender, Kinnars has been deprived of the right to vote, own property or go to schools.  In 2005, Indian passports office allowed eunuchs to write ""E"" instead of male or female. They are now allowed to take a admission in government school.   Hijras used to work as women servant in olden days apart from performing on wedding and occasions.  They were kept as trusted life guards in female areas and some even become generals in Mughal armies. Malik Kafur was a prominent eunuch who conquered the entire Deccan for Delhi sultan Alauddin Khilji.© 2015 DailyHunt ",10 Interesting Facts About Hijras And Myths Surrounding Their Community ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/stressbuster-epaper-strbusen/10+interesting+facts+about+hijras+and+myths+surrounding+their+community-newsid-66124601
"Based on a complaint filed by the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations (FIRA) against Efficient Brainy, Puttur, the deputy commissioner passed an order to the latter to desist from training in blindfold reading, stated a press release by FIRA president Narendra Nayak. The DC's order, numbered A5/EB/2017-18, was issued on March 24 in this regard.It was claimed by Efficient Brainy that through a super-secret process, children between the age of three and 16 could be turned into geniuses who could read hundreds of pages in a minute, develop astonishing acuity of senses, see things hundreds of miles away and so on.Numerous such centres were opened all over the country, and the owners of these started going around schools with children, who could do many activities with blindfolds on, in tow. These classes would be conducted during holidays and as the process was super secret, no outsiders would be allowed to enter, including the parents. One such centre opened in Puttur and brought out pamphlets claiming that their trained children can do anything with their eyes closed. Following the same, the FIRA lodged a complaint with the DC. Meanwhile, a team constituted by the DDPI, Mangaluru, visited Efficient Brainy, Puttur, and made a report. The team, in its report, observed that the children do not have any special powers but were just peeking through the gaps between the blindfold and nose. © 2015 DailyHunt ","Desist from imparting training in blindfold reading, institute told ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/desist+from+imparting+training+in+blindfold+reading+institute+told-newsid-85594857

"NEW DELHI: India is gearing up to play an advanced role in the Commonwealth, a many-sided alliance that could now work especially glowing for India's global ambition.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to almost double India's financial contribution to the Commonwealth when he heads to London this week for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). That will be followed by India indicating that it is ready to take on greater responsibilities in the Commonwealth and play a leading role in terms of increased Indian activity.This will also be the first time when an Indian PM will be there at a CHOGM since 2009. PM Modi himself left out the last one in Malta.""India's engagement with multilateral bodies has been increasing consistently and the Commonwealth is no different. There is a clear desire to play a greater leadership role in the international arena and the UK wants India, as the largest country in the Commonwealth, to take on a more important role within the organisation,"" said Dinesh Patnaik, deputy high commissioner of India to the UK as quoted by TOI.Modi's bilateral actions in London will embrace an audience with Queen Elizabeth. Worth mentioning here she will be hosting perhaps her last CHOGM summit. It's still uncertain who will take over from her as chief of the Commonwealth. This is expected to be discussed during the leaders' retreat at the Waterloo Chamber of Windsor Castle, which is being scared out of the wits open for the occasion. ""At the retreat, unique to the Commonwealth, heads meet privately to discuss collaboration on global and Commonwealth priorities. They will also consider reform and renewal of the Commonwealth,"" a Commonwealth statement said.Modi will land in the United Kingdom on Tuesday night after bilateral talks in Sweden and an Indo-Nordic summit with Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and Finland in Stockholm.In London, Modi will kick off a day of bilateral summit on Wednesday before a CHOGM dinner hosted by British PM Theresa May at Sky Garden in London. The bilateral meeting will stress on the ""technology partnership"", which was started a while ago. This takes account of British companies ""creating in India"".India-UK trade increased 15% in the past year while Indian issuers raised 5.3 billion pounds on the London Stock Exchange. India is also the fourth largest investor in the UK.

"Cricket is considered a religion in our country and cricketers are considered as demigods. We have seen bowlers delivering lethal balls on the field and batsmen knocking out the ball out of the stadium.

"Squint eyes, or strabismus, is a vision disorder. Both eyes don't work as a team, failing to look in the same direction. One eye can look straight ahead, but the other looks up, down, in, or out. It can happen at any age, but it's most common in kids.1 People can be born with squint eyes from an unknown cause. The condition is sometimes hereditary, so it could even run in the families. Other times, squint eye develops in children from short-sightedness, long-sightedness, and astigmatism. The eyes try to overcome these vision issues, but end up losing muscle control.2 Stroke, Down syndrome, and injuries to the eye and brain can cause squint in adults. It may also develop from childhood eye problems that were never treated.3    Pencil push-ups are easy workouts that treat convergence insufficiency. This condition means that the eyes can't converge - or move toward each other - to focus on the same thing. Aside from squint eyes, it can also cause headaches, blurry vision, and eye strain.To do a pencil push-up, all you need is a pencil. Hold it at arm's length in between your eyes. Move the pencil toward your nose, but try to keep looking at it. Focus on seeing the pencil as a single image. Once you see double, move the pencil away.Studies have shown that two sets of 20 push-ups daily have awesome benefits. If this seems too much, do one set of 10 pencil push-ups each day.4   A tool called a Brock string can boost eye coordination. It costs about 10 dollars, but you can make one. A Brock string is usually a 10-foot cord with 3 or 5 wooden beads of different colors.To use a Brock string, tie one end to a stationary object like a chair. Move the beads into equal intervals and hold the string up to your nose, pulling it taut. Focus on the bead that's closest to your face. You should start seeing two strings that cross at the bead, creating an X. Aim to see an X at all the beads, except the farthest one. Here, the strings will look like a V.This form of vision therapy can be done daily. Exercises to fix squint eyes for children can also include the Brock string since it's like a game. The aspect of color recognition will add a fun twist.  Using a Barrel card is another easy way to improve convergence. Making one is simple. Draw three circles across an index card, each one a little bigger than the last. Repeat on the other side, in the same order - but in green.To do this exercise, hold it up to your nose in a horizontal position. The smallest circles should be closest to you. Focus on both of the larger circles until you see a single red-green circle. Hold for five seconds. Repeat with the middle circle, and again with the smallest one.Do this workout once a day. While Barrel cards are good exercises to fix squint eyes for adults, children can also benefit. You can even make several cards with different shapes and colors.Check with your doctor before doing these exercises. He might have you do them in his office first. This way, he can give you feedback and make sure you know how to do them right.Do these exercises in a quiet room, free of distractions (this include pets, kids, and other people in your home). It will let you focus on the workouts - literally!Early detection is key for proper treatment. Both kids and adults should regularly visit the eye doctor, even if they don't wear glasses. It's the best way to help both eyes stay in good shape.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Top 3 Exercises For Squint Eyes (Strabismus) You Must Try ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/curejoy-epaper-curejoy/top+3+exercises+for+squint+eyes+strabismus+you+must+try-newsid-68335699
"A Facebook post on communal violence by Dr Nelson Joseph, who practices at Lakeshore Hospital in Kochi, has gone viral and is now being discussed and debated widely by netizens across the country.In his write-up titled 'An open letter to all Indians from Kerala', Nelson discusses an incident where a temple in Malappuram was vandalised and points out how certain powerful 'leaders' use lies and deceit to create differences between people of varied backgrounds and religions.The original letter in Malayalam had over 2300 reactions and was shared over 1700 times on Facebook, while the English version saw 1900 reactions and 1400 shares.Several politicians, celebrities and activists such as filmmaker Aashiq Abu, have promoted the post. The English version of the letter also found tremendous popularity on Twitter and Reddit, stirring strong debates. Let's first take a look at the incident in question. On Saturday, a temple in a village near Nilambur in Malappuram district was found desecrated and the idols vandalised. The incident was almost immediately followed by a hartal led a couple of Hindutva groups. Then commenced a campaign, both direct and through social media, urging Hindus in Kerala to be ready to open refugee camps across the southern districts of the state. There were also rumours of an even bigger 'an attack on Hindus' and possible Muslim involvement. This resulted in the escalation of the religious tension in the area and, to a lesser extent, across the state. Mohanakumar SS. Photo courtesy: Twitter However, the incident didn't boil over to anything untoward, thanks to the Kerala police. Within 24 hours the local cops arrested Mohanakumar SS, a Thiruvananthapuram native, in connection with the temple desecration case and booked him under IPC Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion) among other sections. Though Mohanakumar confessed to the crime, when asked about the motive he would only say that he did it to protest against the bad customs in the Hinduism. The police said he is a goon for hire and is an accused in a murder that happened 11 years ago.Nelson's letter raises a few important questions regarding the incidents. Mohanakumar travelled more than 350 kms just to protest against bad customs. And just by co-incidence he chose a temple in the district with the largest Muslim population in the state. Also, the incident happened the very next day after the cattle slaughter ban order was announced and on the first day of Ramadan and the day of the beef fests. Too much of a co-incidence, don't you think? The doctor also points out that prior to the 2002 Gujarat riots, a prominent local newspaper had reported an incident that the bodies of two Hindu women were found on the banks of a river. It was proved to be a fabricated story days later but the damage was already done.Nelson concludes the letter by warning his fellow Indians that these incidents will keep on happening. He also lists out three things we should all take into consideration at testing times.Do not jump to conclusions. If someone says that ""Hindus are not allowed to venture out to the Attingal sea"", first ask is it true or at least ask does Attingal have a sea or a beach or at least a lagoon.If someone poses as your savior or of your religion, first think who will have the ultimate gain. You or him? If a leader tells you to go and kill someone for Hindutva/ Christianity/ Islam, first think is it for him or for the betterment of ""said religion"".We are educated for a reason. Ask for the source of facts and figures. Try to understand the truth.The doctor signs off with the words ""No one - neither some leader at Delhi or Lok Sabha or somewhere else - can replace your immediate neighbour in the time of need.""Read the full post in English here:© 2015 DailyHunt ","Kerala doctor's open letter to fellow Indians goes viral, even celebs are sharing it ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/kerala+doctor+s+open+letter+to+fellow+indians+goes+viral+even+celebs+are+sharing+it-newsid-68324623

"  Putting its focus on streamlining the traffic and ensuring smooth vehicular movement in old city, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has decided to construct two new flyovers - one from Aramgarh to Zoo Park and second, from Nalgonda crossroads to Owaisi junction. The two flyovers are to be taken up under Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP).These two routes fall under the high traffic zone category and dotted with residential clusters as well as commercial establishments, are beehive of activity for most part of the day and till late in the night.The prevailing traffic chaos on the route which often resulted in accidents, small and big, the local residents have been demanding measures to smoothen the vehicular movement.  Accordingly, the municipal corporation has roped in consultants to study the conditions on both road stretches and prepare a report along with recommendations on feasible alternative. With several religious structures located all along the routes and scarce availability of road space, the consultants have recommended flyovers here, said a senior official from GHMC.In its report submitted to the civic body, the STUP Consultants recommended a four-lane flyover from Nalgonda crossroads till Owaisi Junction and the cost of the project has been estaimated to be around Rs 523 crore.This road stretch has several bottlenecks and taking up road widening was ruled out due to the presence of religious structures, graveyards and others all through via Chanchalguda, Saidabad and Santosh Nagar.The proposed four-lane flyover will cover a distance of about five km. The estimated cost of the flyover also includes land acquisition and few other structures that need to be dismantled, besides taking up miscellaneous works.Similarly, the Aramgarh to Zoo Park route is also on a high traffic zone and the present four-lane and two-lane roads on the route were found to be not able in ensuring free flow of traffic.For this road stretch, the CE Testing company submitted its report recommending a six-lane flyover from Aramgarh to Zoo Park. Given the National Police Academy and Miralam Tank boundary, road widening was not found to be a feasible option and as part of the flyover construction, a few structures were identified for removal. The total cost of the flyover is estimated to be about Rs 636 crore.The municipal corporation would be placing both the proposals before the standing committee for approval. Once the standing committee gives its nod, administrative sanction would be sought from the State government, said the official.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Two new flyovers for Hyderabad's old city ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/telangana+today-epaper-telantod/two+new+flyovers+for+hyderabad+s+old+city-newsid-80736521

"Wear clean underwear. Isn't it something you were taught in childhood? Then why start unlearning the good things? Wearing clean, fresh, and washed underwear is something you need to do every day, just like the way you brush your teeth every morning, irrespective of how busy you are.There is no valid reason why you wouldn't do this on a daily basis. No, bathing doesn't make it any better! Bathing and wearing the same underwear is just as bad and wearing it inside out doesn't change anything either. Here are 5 reasons why you must ensure that you wear clean and washed underwear every day.  Practicing good hygiene should be an essential part of your life as it is important for good health. Taking a bath, brushing your teeth, and wearing washed clothes every day are all a part of your basic hygiene.Wearing clean underwear is primarily for your personal hygiene. Fresh underwear is free from microbes and bacteria that can have adverse effects on your health.  Underwears help to absorb sweat, but not changing it on a daily basis can increase the risk of yeast infection as yeast and bacteria thrive in a moist environment. A dirty pair of underwear may have traces of feces on it. The bacteria from the fecal matter can spread to your urinary tract, resulting in a urinary tract infection. To prevent infections, you need to ensure that you wear clean, dry underwear each day.  Your skin may turn itchy if you have been sitting in the same underwear and clothes for a day or two. What starts with just an itch can soon turn into a rash or sore.Although these rashes can be treated easily, it is always better to prevent them by wearing fresh and bacteria-free underwear. If you notice a rash, clean the area and ensure that you start changing your underwear regularly. If it still doesn't heal, visit your doctor at the earliest.  How do you feel when you have a shower and put on clean clothes? It is certainly better than the way you felt before you cleaned yourself.The dirt, sweat, and bacteria can make you extremely uncomfortable. Additionally, it can have a negative impact on your sexual life. Not only will the stains and itch make you and them uncomfortable, the other person is also put at the risk of an infection due to your negligence.  You must have noticed a strange odor from down there. This is a sign for you to change. Although the vagina cleans itself, the other parts remain dirty and need to be kept clean.This unpleasant smell and infection caused due to dirty underwear can affect your self-confidence as you may hesitate to have a social interaction. The fear of other people smelling the foul odor can keep you from talking to them. It is always better to stick to cotton underwear instead of silk or nylon ones. Cotton underwears let your skin breathe and prevent infections. Wearing tight underwear can lead to an infection as the moisture is trapped.© 2015 DailyHunt ",5 Reasons Why It Is Important To Wear Clean Underwear ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/curejoy-epaper-curejoy/5+reasons+why+it+is+important+to+wear+clean+underwear-newsid-76440933

"The Auto Expo 2018 was packed with new launches, unveils and interesting showcases, of which, the majority was comprised of scooters. Before you hit the Expo this weekend, we bring you a list of the top five scooters at the Auto Expo 2018.  The Aprilia SR 150 is certainly one of the sportiest scooters in India today, but it is also priced towards the premium end of the spectrum at Rs 70,939 (ex-showroom, Pune). In order to grab hold of a larger audience, Aprilia launched the SR 125 at Rs 65,310 (ex-showroom, Pune) and unveiled the Storm 125 . In terms of styling, both the scooters looks similar to the Aprilia SR 150. But the key difference between the Storm 125 from the SR 125 is the wheel size.The Storm 125 sports 12-inch wheels instead of the 14-inch ones seen on the SR range. That said, these are the fattest tyres seen on a scooter, with the front being a 120/80 section rubber, while the rear gets a 130/80 section tyre. Other difference includes bright colours and funky new graphics. It will also come with different optional accessories such as a large windscreen. Powering this scooter is a 124.49cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine sourced from the Vespa VXL/SXL 125. Mated to a CVT transmission, the Storm 125 delivers 9.65PS of power at 7,250rpm and 9.9Nm of torque at 6,250rpm.Suspension duties are carried out by telescopic front forks and an adjustable rear monoshock. As is the case with SR branded scooters, the Storm also gets a disc brake up front, with a drum brake at the rear. Once launched, we expect the Storm 125 to be priced at approximately Rs 67,000 (ex-showroom).  Honda unveiled a total of 11 models at the Auto Expo 2018, one of which was the new generation Activa 5G. The scooter has received a few subtle updates for the new year. Honda also introduced an additional variant of the scooter, known as the 'Deluxe' variant wherein, along with the standard features you also get a semi-digital instrument console which shows ECO options and service due indicator.The standard features include an all-LED headlamp - a feature that was first introduced by the Honda Grazia in the segment -, chrome inserts on the front apron and two new colour options - Metallic Yellow and Red. Other than that, the scooter remains unchanged. It is still powered by the old 109cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine, which produces 8PS of power at 7,500rpm and 9Nm of torque at 5,500rpm. With the few modern touches, the Activa 5G certainly adds a dash of freshness over the Activa 4G that it replaces. Prices aren't announced yet, but we expect the new model to be available at a price hike of around Rs 1500 over the Activa 4G that costs Rs 51,460 (ex-showroom, Delhi).   Suzuki also made its presence felt at the Auto Expo 2018 by unveiling the Suzuki Burgman Street. In terms of design, it sports a maxi-scooter inspired look with its large windscreen and split LED headlamp placed within the front apron, on top of the mudguard. The fully-digital instrument console sits right in between the handlebar and the windscreen. There is a multi-function key slot, generous underseat storage and a 12V charging socket as well. The rider seat section is slightly tapered down, whereas the pillion seat looks broad. At the rear, it sports a single-piece grab rail and a single-piece cluster consisting of an LEDtaillight and side indicators.It packs the same engine that is seen on the Suzuki Access 125. This 124cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder unit produces 8.7PS of power at 7,000rpm and a peak torque of 10.2Nm at 5,000rpm.With the Burgman range available internationally, Suzuki has always focused on comfort. So expect the Burgman Street to offer the same in India. To the same effect, the Burgman Street features telescopic forks up front and a monoshock at the back. The 90/90-12 front tyre gets a disc brake, while the 90/100-10 rear wheel is bolted with a drum brake.Suzuki is expected to launch the Burgman Street soon. Expect it to be approximately Rs 7,000 costlier than the Suzuki Access 125.  The Aprilia SR 150 has been updated for 2018. These updates include new livery for the 'Race' variant, new colours including a Carbon Se edition for the standard model and a semi-digital instrument console. Other than these changes, the scooter remains unchanged mechanically and cosmetically.It packs the same 154.8cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine, which delivers 10.5PS of power and 11.4Nm of torque. The 2018 model will most likely replace the ongoing SR 150 and will be priced the same at Rs 70,939 (ex-showroom, Pune).  Just a day before the Auto Expo 2018, TVS launched its first ever 125cc scooter - the NTorq 125 - at a price of Rs 58,750 (ex-showroom Delhi). The scooter is edgy and has been designed to look sporty to attract many young buyers. It certainly has taken a lot of inspiration from the Graphite concept that was showcased at the Auto Expo 2016. The NTorq 125 is also the first Indian scooter to get Bluetooth connectivity. Its fully digital instrument console hosts a total of 55 features including navigation assist, a lap timer, engine oil temperature, top speed recorder, last park location assist and a service reminder to name a few.Powering the scooter is an all-new 124.79cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder motor. It churns out 9.4PS of power at 7,500rpm and 10.5Nm of torque at 5,500rpm.Suspension duties here are handled by telescopic forks up front, while the rear houses twin gas-charged shock absorbers. Braking is done via a front 220mm disc and a rear 130mm drum brake.At Rs 58,750, the TVS NTORQ 125 scooter comes across a great value for money option since the Honda Grazia, its closest rival, is priced at Rs 58,155.Source : www.zigwheels.com © 2015 DailyHunt ","Top 5 Scooters At Auto Expo 2018: Honda Activa 5G, TVS NTORQ And More...

"Rajasthan Royals all-rounder, Jofra , seems to be fit and available for selection in the playing XI, for the team's next tie against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).The update over his fitness is revealed by the franchise through a video - #RoyalFans, want to see our @craig_arch in action? Wait no longer, here you go!!Are you excited to him in the #Royals' jersey??#HallaBol #IPL2018 #Cricket pic.twitter.com/pGIGcRTwtY - Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) April 12, 2018 The promising talent Archer missed the first two games for his side.As he has failed to recover from the side strain. The bowling all-rounder suffered the injury during Pakistan Super League (PSL) which resulted in him being ruled out midway through the tournament.He had a late arrival in Rajasthan Royals' camp and also skipped major part of team's practice camp.After his arrival, he missed two games but now seems to fit to play the game. He is might replace D'Arcy Short in the playing XI if given a chance.The Australian batsman Short has failed to capitalise on the opportunity in the two innings he has played - getting out in form of run-out in both the games as well. It was an unfortunate sight for the hard-hitting batsman.Opening innings with Short also means Rahul Tripathi to play in the middle-order.If Archer is added in the playing XI, it will give an opportunity to Royals - to promote Tripathi. The aggressive batsman could open the innings with skipper Ajinkya Rahane.Archer will play the role of the finisher in that case.The franchise showed faith in him during the IPL auction and shelled out INR 7.20 crore for him.The first game against Sunrisers Hyderabad turned out to be a one-sided affair and SRH eclipsed the target of 126 in 16th over.In the second game, Rajasthan Royals returned back strongly by defending a target of 71 in six overs, in a rain-curtailed game against Delhi Daredevils.The pressure was on Delhi Daredevils to achieve the target and they could manage 60 runs in six overs.Royals will look to continue the winning run when playing away from home against Royal Challengers Bangalore on April 15.About last night !!!#Royal hurricane @craig_arch at the Amer fort !!!

"His kids must have a royal life too. Right?Mukesh Ambani is the most renowned businessman in India. He even comes in the list of leading successful people in the world. If we talk about the development Ambani Group has made, we all know that Mukesh Ambani left no stone unturned to achieve everything he has today. His hard work is the reason that today he stands at the point where he can have anything he wants. But even after being on cloud 9, he has his feet on the ground. Looking at the lifestyle of Ambani family, you must think that they obviously enjoy their life to the fullest?Ambani being such a billionaire, his kids must have a royal life too. Right? So, what I have brought for you people today is some inside information of Ambani family which will clear all your queries. Let's see what is the pocket money of Ambani kids.Mukesh Ambani is the most successful businessman among the Ambani group. And when it comes to the personal life, he is a successful father as well. Mukesh and Nita Ambani have made sure to grow up their kids Isha, Anant and Akash in proper guidance to make them better human beings. Though Nita is the wife of the biggest businessmen in the country, she makes sure that her kids don't get into the glamour of money. Nita herself is from a middle-class family and for going to her college or school, she used to take a local bus. Rather than sending kids in their personal luxury cars, Nita Ambani used to send her kids to school by the public transport bus. This was to make them aware of the lifestyle and problems of a common man. ""Life is about being aware of things around,"" says Nita. During an interview in 2011, Nita revealed that ""When my kids were still young, I'd give them Rs 5 each and every Friday to spend in the school canteen.""    ""One day, my youngest, Anant, came running into my bedroom and demanded for Rs 10 instead,"" Nita said.    ""When I questioned him, he said his pals in school laughed whenever they saw him take out a five-rupee coin saying,'Tu Ambani hai ya bhikari!' Mukesh and I couldn't help but crack up,"" Nita added. As I have already told you that Nita Ambani is from a middle-class family, she narrates, "" My mum was a disciplinarian and we were barely allowed to go out - just four times in a year - and there was no pocket money given. Not to mention my curfew, which was midnight."" Before getting married to Mukesh Ambani, Nita always wanted to become a teacher. But after marriage, she got into the responsibility of the family.And you wouldn't believe how Nita's maids call her...Nita Ambani, just like her husband has feet on the ground. An example for this is that the maids in her house don't call her Madam or Mrs Ambani, they call her 'Bhabhi'. I hope you liked the story. Got a story?

"Since the inception of T20I cricket, the game has witnessed more close finishes. Many games have gone on the wire and won on the last ball.The introduction of twenty overs cricket has also kept the fans on their toes with the game changing very quickly. Meanwhile, many batsmen have won it for their team hitting a six in the last ball of the match.Most recently, Dinesh Karthik's six of the last ball won the match for India against Bangladesh in the Nidahas Trophy final.Let us take a look at the list of batsmen, who has hit a six to win the match in the last ball:  Kapugedara's massive six in the last ball of the game handed Sri Lanka a nail-biter against India. He charged down the track and carves the last delivery from Ashish Nehra over sweeper cover for six to pull off a final-ball victory.Meanwhile, he remained unbeaten on 37 runs off 16 deliveries including two boundaries and three sixes.In reply to India's 163, Sri Lanka had a poor start losing two wickets. However, it was the late cameo from Kapugedara that won the match for Sri Lanka by five wickets.  The current England skipper played a magical knock against India at Wankhede in 2012. He won the match for his team hitting Ashok Dinda a six of the last delivery of the game.Morgan smashed the ball straight back over Dinda's head for six. The delivery was arching for the yorker but ended up being a half-volley in Morgan's hitting arc and he made no mistake, kabooming the ball over the rope with a free-flowing swing of the arms.England eventually won the match by six wickets as Morgan remained unbeaten on 49 runs.Especially a bowler, Zulfiqar struck a massive six off Marlon Samuels to help Pakistan win the 1st T20I. Zulfiqar, playing his debut game got under one low full toss from Samuels to clear the long off boundary. He remained unbeaten on 13 runs which is his highest T20I score.Meanwhile, Pakistan chased down the target o 153 with two wickets in hand.The right-handed struck one massive six from Ahsan Malik to win it for Zimbabwe in group league matches in the World T20.Malik missed his length for once, sending down an overpitched ball as Sibanda gets low and wallops this high over long on. Sibanda remained unbeaten on 9 runs providing good support Brendan Taylor.Zimbabwe won the thriller of a match by five wickets.Karthik struck Soumya Sarkar for a massive six to win the Nidahas Trophy for India earlier today. Karthik's little cameo at the end will be etched in every cricket lover's mind.India needed five runs to win when Karthik struck a flat and rocking six to win the game. Meanwhile, he remained unbeaten on 29 of 8 deliveries including three sixes and two boundaries. He also received the man of the match award.India won the match by four wickets to win the Nidahas Trophy.Further, here is the newsfeed: Vidarbha clinch Irani Trophy title for 1st time © 2015 DailyHunt ",Stats: List of Batsmen to hit Six on the Last ball to win a T20I match ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/sportzwiki+english-epaper-sptwiken/stats+list+of+batsmen+to+hit+six+on+the+last+ball+to+win+a+t20i+match-newsid-83902807

"      Although the undivided Kalaburagi district (which included the present day Yadgir district ) was a strong bastion of the Congress since Independence, it was the emergence of the Janata Parivar in the early eighties that broke the stranglehold of the Congress in the region. Of late, the BJP too has gained a foothold in the district, especially after Lingayat leader and former CM B.S. Yeddyurappa assumed the mantle of the party at the state level.The political leadership of Kalaburagi has not only dominated the politics of Hyderabad-Karnataka but has also played a key role in state politics. After the downfall of former CM Veerendra Patil in the early nineties, Mallikarjun Kharge and Dharam Singh totally dominated Congress affairs not only in the district but also in the region.In the 2013 Assembly election, the Congress made big gains in the district winning seven of the nine seats due to two factors-the conferring of special status on the backward H-K region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution and the division of BJP votes due to launch of the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) by Mr Yeddyurappa. As a result, the BJP which had won five seats in the district in 2004, was able to retain only one in 2013- Gulbarga South- where the Revoor family can sway voters like no one else. On the other hand, the Congress tally improved from four in 2004 to seven in 2013.But a lot of water has flowed under the Bhima bridge since the 2013 election. The issue of conferring special status on the HK region has faded from public memory and it's no more a dominant factor in this election. And secondly, former BJP leaders who had quit the party to join KJP, have reverted to their parent organization. The third factor which may work against the Congress is the demise of two prominent leaders- N Dharam Singh and Qamrul Islam, who had a large following in the district.Although Mr Kharge has emerged much stronger now at the national level with his appointment as Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, his influence has been affected after senior leaders such as Malikayya Guttedar, late Qamrul Islam besides former ministers from neighbouring Yadgir district, Dr Malakraddy and Baburao Chinchansur raised the banner of revolt against him following the elevation of his son Priyank Kharge as Minister. Although these leaders are lying low at the moment, they are expected to strike at the right moment during the coming elections and could affect the prospects of the party.The absence of Mr Singh, who was known for his suave style and his ability to strike a chord with people, may affect the chances of the Congress not only in Jewargi which he represented eight times without a break, but also in many constituencies not only in the district but in neighbouring Bidar district as well. Similarly the sudden demise of Mr Islam, who was the unchallenged leader of the dominant Muslim community in the district, has created a big void in the community.Till Mr Islam was alive, winning the Gulbarga North seat (earlier Gulbarga Assembly) was an easy task for the party. But now, retaining the seat and also the Muslim vote bank has now become a big challenge as Mr Islam never allowed a second rung leader to grow in the party. While the followers of Mr Islam are demanding the ticket for Mr Islam's wife, it's ultimately Mr Kharge who will have the last word on the issue. If Mr Kharge, who was at loggerheads with late Islam, decides to back his follower Ilyas Bhagwan, whom he got appointed as chairman of the North-West Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and refuses the ticket to Mr Islam's wife, the party may see a major upheaval.Another worry for the Congress in the constituency is Mr Nasir Hussain who may contest as the JD(S) candidate. Till Mr Islam was alive, Mr Hussain, who contested in the previous election as KJP candidate, could not succeed much in winning over the Muslim electorate. But the absence of Mr Islam has created a big opportunity for this young leader. Some political observers are ready to bet on Mr Hussain saying if there is a chance of JD(S) winning a lone seat, it's this one. The BJP contenders for the Gulbarga North seat are senior leader Mr Shashil Namoshi, entrepreneur Rajgopal Reddy and industrialist B.G. Patil's son Chandu Patil.In the Kalaburagi South seat where sitting BJP MLA Dattatreya Patil Revoor will be the candidate again, he may face a challenge from the Congress, which is yet to finalise its candidate and from an independent, Basavaraj Diggavi as well. If the latter, who is likely to eat into the BJP vote bank, manages to garner substantial votes, then he may help the chances of the Congress candidate.Congressmen in the race for this seat are former MLC Allamprabhu Patil, Kalaburagi Mayor Sharanu Modi and the Block Congress President Neelakant Mulage.In so far as the Kalaburagi Rural constituency is concerned, the scene is pretty hazy. Due to old age and poor health, the Congress has decided not to give the ticket to sitting MLA G Ramakrishna this time. He may be replaced by son Vijaykumar. In the BJP, former minister Revu Naik, who got elected four times from the constituency without a break before losing in the 2013 election due to the entry of the KJP candidate, would have bagged the ticket on a platter as he enjoys a good rapport not only with his Banjara community, who are in substantial numbers in the constituency, but also with other communities. But his decision to continue in the BJP when the KJP was launched by Mr Yeddyurappa, has strained his relationship with the latter. In case the party leadership rejects his plea for the Assembly ticket on the ground he would be the candidate for the Kalaburagi Lok Sabha seat in 2019, a Zilla Panchayat member, Basavaraj Mattimud or the BJP State Vice-President Baburao Chavan, who contested on the KJP ticket in 2013, may be the candidate.In the high profile Chittapur constituency, minister Priyank Kharge has made the going tough for himself due to his 'inaccessibility' and 'autocratic' style of functioning. Although Mr Priyank has been able to bring a lot of funds to his constituency, he has earned a lot of enemies owing to his abrasive style.Recently a big chunk of leaders led by former MLA Vishwanth Patil Hebbal left the Congress protesting against his ""style of functioning"" and their neglect in the party. This feeling is widespread and may make the going tough for him at the hustings. Considering the high percentage of Lambani voters in the constituency, the BJP has decided to field its former MLA, Valmiki Naik, who won in the 2009 by-election, but lost to Priyank in 2013, from Chittapur again.In Afzalpur, six term Congress MLA Malikayya Guttedar is pitted against his traditional rival M.Y. Patil, who will be in the fray this time as BJP candidate. An old war horse Mr Patil entered politics in the seventies and has been fighting elections without a break on different party symbols since 1978. But he has been able to get elected only twice- in 1978 and 2004. In 2013, he fought on a KJP ticket. It remains to be seen whether Mr Patil's appeal to voters to give him a last chance will see him through (He has decided not to contest in future).Going by the outstanding performance of the BJP under Mr Patil's stewardship in the recent Zilla Panchayat and taluk panchayat elections in Afzalpur taluk, one may get the impression that he may have an easy win in the coming Assembly election. But political observers believe that as in the previous elections Mr Guttedar, who wields 'enormous money, muscle and liquor power,' will marshal his resources well on time to inflict a defeat on his rivals, including those in the Congress party who want to see his downfall. In Aland too, the fight will be between two traditional rivals- B.R. Patil and Subash Guttedar. In the changed scenario, Mr Patil, who won the previous election on a KJP ticket, is trying his luck on the Congress ticket this time. Mr Patil wanted to join the BJP as he had quit the Congress on the eve of the 2013 Assembly election to protest against the 'stranglehold' of Mr Kharge and Mr Singh on the Congress. But before he could join the saffron party, Mr Guttedar, who was in the JD(S), staged a coup of sorts by joining the BJP, thus upstaging the plans of Mr Patil. Mr Guttedar has won the seat thrice in 1994 (KCP), 1999 and 2008 (both JDS) and is testing the waters again on a BJP ticket this time.In Jewargi, sitting Congress MLA Dr Ajay Singh will have a tough time as he is going to face the elections without his father, who had the knack of winning over people. Taking on Dr Singh will be Doddappagowda Patil Naribol of the BJP and Mr Kedarlingaiah Hiremath of the JD(S).In Sedam, Medical Education Minister Dr Sharanprakash Patil is sitting pretty. Although the BJP has not yet finalised its candidate, its former district president Rajkumar Telkur is likely to be given a final chance. He has lost to Dr Patil thrice so far. In the reserved Chincholi constituency, the fight will be between sitting Congress MLA Dr Umesh Jadhav and former Minister Sunil Valyapure, who will be the BJP candidate.The Rashtrakutas, the Bahmani kings and then the Mughals, Kalaburagi's rich history- evident from the numerous ancient monuments dotting the district- is intertwined with political strife. There may be just nine seats up for grabs but this is the land of Veerendra Patil, Kharge and Dharam Singh-all stalwarts who etched their names in state politics and had to rise to the heights through toil and struggle warding off the challenge from less worthy politicians. And for this very reason, anyone expecting to make it quick and fast to the state assembly, riding on money or muscle power like in most polls, is surely in for a rude shock.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Battleground k'taka: Kalaburagi will make every candidate sweat and sweat for a win ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/battleground+k+taka+kalaburagi+will+make+every+candidate+sweat+and+sweat+for+a+win-newsid-80270931
" Early in the morning today (March 31, 2018) air hostesses of the third largest airline in the country, SpiceJet protested at the Chennai Airport. They alleged that the airline's security staff strip-searched them.The protesting air hostesses alleged that they are being put into uncomfortable situations from past many days. From touching them inappropriately to checking them even when they were menstruating, they have faced it all. When the investigating journalists spoke to the airlines, they claimed that it is all a part of their security process which is similar to that of the passengers.They called the entire protest baseless. Here's what the report said:SpiceJet's air hostesses alleged that they were being strip-searched from last few days after they deboarded their flights.The airlines and other staff members insisted that cabin crew's search is the similar to the security check done with other passengers boarding the flight.""We have therefore been compelled to carry out spot checks, which in any case is a company policy. It is in all our interests that the 'black sheep' amongst us is identified and removed so that honest employees are not blamed,"" Kamal Hingorani said in an email to the airline employees.The protecting air hostess shared that they are not allowed to go to the washroom directly after deboarding from flights. An air hostess with 10 years of experience shared, ""We air hostesses are stripped naked over the last three days and women personnel touch us inappropriately. A colleague in her period was asked to remove her sanitary napkin."" NDTV saw some of the complaint emails that were sent by the cabin crew. ""We cabin crew are hired majorly for safety reasons of the fellow passengers but what about our respect and safety? We talk about rape and molestation, is this any less,"" an email read.  ""On informing the base official that I wasn't comfortable and I'm on my menses she still checked my panty; they pressed my breasts. I've lost my self-respect... Cabin crew is the brand ambassador. We are humiliated as if we have done some robbery,"" one of the air hostesses said in the email. A senior SpiceJet official in Chennai alleged, ""It's a baseless allegation"".  ""I can't comment. I'm not at the base right now,"" said another Chennai-based SpiceJet official.    That's all, folks.

" : Padmanabhanagar is one of the important assembly segments in Bengaluru south. At present it is represented by R Ashok of BJP in the State Assembly for the second time. Prior to this, Ashok got elected thrice from the erstwhile Uttarahalli constituency in 1997 (by-election), 1999, and 2004. Padmanabhanagar Assembly constituency is carved out of Uttarahalli constituency.In 2008, BJP candidate R. Ashok contested from Uttarahalli and defeated Congress candidate Gurappa Naidu with a huge majority of 39,402 votes. While Ashok has got 61,561 votes, Gurappa Naidu has managed to get only 22,159 votes.Ashok again proved his popularity among the voters of Padmanabhanagar by getting elected to the State Assembly in 2013 too. He defeated Congress candidate Chetan Gowda L.S., the son of veteran politicians L.R. Shivarame Gowda, by a margin of 20,123 votes. Ashok's total number of votes has come down in 2013 at 53,680 votes as against 61,561 in 2008. Congress candidate got 33,557 votes while BJP candidate polled 53,680 votes. The JD(S) candidate Dr. M.R.V. Prasad was in the third place with 26,272 votes.""The reason for the BJP candidate's success in the Assembly elections is the domination of Brahmin and Vokkaliga voters in this Assembly constituency. There are around 40,000 Brahmins and more than 35,000 Vokkaliga voters here. While the Brahmins are traditional voters of BJP, Vokkaligas support Ashok who is a Vokkaliga,'' says Sreekanth Srinivasa, a resident of Padmanabhanagar.The other advantage for the BJP is the proactive attitude of Ashok who is always in the news for one reason or the other. ""Let it be a BJP state unit meeting or any protest, Ashok will be in the forefront. He interacts with the voters,'' opines Karunesh S, a resident of Banashankari.This constituency comprises eight Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wards such as Padmanabhanagar, Ganesha Mandira, Yediyur, Hosakerehalli, Karisandra, Banashankari Devasthana, Kumaraswamy Layout, and Chikka Kallasandra.Among the eight wards, seven are represented by BJP corporators such as Rajeshwari Cholaraja K (Hosakerehalli), D.H. Lakshmi (Ganesh Mandira), Yashoda I (Karisandra), Poornima Ramesh (Yadiyur), L Srinivas (Kumaraswamy Layout), Shobha Anjanappa (Padmanabhanagar), and Supriya Sekhar (Chikka Kallasandra) in the BBMP Council while Congress corporator Ansar Pasha S represents Banashankari Devasthana ward.The constituency also has many lower middle class and slum areas which are a picture of neglect without even basic amenities and access to healthcare. Places like Katriguppe, Ilyasnagar, Kaverinagar, Hittamandu and Umar Bagh are typical examples of this. Mosquito and dog menace is rampant here.""We want our elected representative to pressurize the BMBP authorities to fix infrastructure and health-related problems as early as possible,'' complains Krishne Gowda, a resident of Banashankari.Meanwhile, BJP activists and corporators are confident of their leader romping home again in 2018 State Assembly elections. ""It is true our leader Ashok's margin of votes was less compared to the votes he got in 2008. There was a split among Brahmin voters since JD(S) had fielded Dr. M.R.V. Prasad who belongs to Brahmin community. With Prasad has already joining BJP, there will be no stiff competition for Ashok during the next Assembly election,'' said Rajeswari Cholaraj K, corporator of Hosakerehalli ward.If the above factors any indication, it seems nothing will stop BJP candidate Ashok achieving a hat-trick from Padmanabhanagar in 2018.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Padmanabhanagar: BJP candidate R Ashok set to achieve hat-trick ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news+karnataka-epaper-newskarn/padmanabhanagar+bjp+candidate+r+ashok+set+to+achieve+hat+trick-newsid-73261036
" There is something about death that makes the best of us shudder to our very core though it is the least we want to worry about. But we human beings have adopted the best way of tackling this aspect. How do we do that? By accepting it and not thinking about it. Because we know death is inevitable.

"Well, there are motorcycles and then, there's the Royal Enfield. With its roots at The Enfield Cycle Company Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire, this South India-based motorcycle manufacturer enjoys a cult status in India. However, all is not hunky-dory with their motorcycles. Here's a look at the good, the bad and the ugly things about Royal Enfield motorcycles.  One of the biggest selling points of these motorcycles is their high retro appeal. The basic design of most of the Royal Enfield motorcycles has been unchanged since time immemorial.All this means that you get classic looks that are on the verge of becoming eternally timeless.  Royal Enfield motorcycles are high on character. There are many who won't settle for anything but a pure mechanical feel. The turbine-like smoothness of the modern-day Japanese motorcycles just won't cut it for them. The loud thump of a Royal Enfield motorcycle, the metal panels, and the many classy bits like an analog speedo - these are just some of the many bits that give these motorcycles a distinctive nature. There's no denying the high comfort levels that these motorcycles have on offer. The seats offer just the right amount of cushioning, enough support and can easily keep you comfortable over long rides. Another major highlight here is the correct ergonomics. Thanks to their simple design, the ergonomics are just spot on, especially for the well-built and the tall ones. While all that retro charm has been working really well for this South India-based company, it doesn't look like the boffins at RE are the ones to sit on their laurels. In spite of all the success that the Classic and the Bullet range of motorcycles enjoy, the company, of late, has been regular with bringing in new products (Read: Continental GT, Himalayan, Thunderbird X). Oh, and we really can't wait to get our hands on the upcoming 650cc twins.   With prices of the Royal Enfield range starting at roughly Rs 1.13 lakh, the REs are much pricier than a major chunk of motorcycles on sale in the country. More than the high pricing, it's actually the lack of features and new technology that make these products look a bit exorbitantly priced. Admit it, a high-quality control has never been RE's forte. The quality of parts, in spite of some improvement in recent times, hasn't been anything to write about. Many parts are prone to break or fall apart while the paint fades away much quicker, too. The Himalayan is the only Royal Enfield motorcycle that offers ABS. Every other motorcycle, including the recently launched Thunderbird 350X and 500X, don't offer ABS. Also, earlier REs are (in)famous for their poor brakes. Improving safety levels is one area where the manufacturer should really focus.  Many 350cc models of RE are even slower than the likes of the much cheaper Bajaj Pulsar 180. Even the now-defunct Continental GT 535, which is easily the sportiest RE we've seen so far, has a top speed of just about 130 kmph.   The worst thing about Royal Enfield is that the manufacturer just won't improve its quality levels. Even the newer bikes, like the Himalayan, are marred by poor quality check and sub-standard parts. In fact, Royal Enfield had to replace a large quantity of parts on the Himalayan even after the motorcycles reached customers. To be fair, we acknowledge the higher reliability of the newer REs. However, these motorcycles still have a long way to go before their reliability is comparable to that of even motorcycles from Bajaj or TVS. This is something that's quite a put-off, especially when you take into account the high price you pay to buy these motorcycles.© 2015 DailyHunt ","Royal Enfield motorcycles: The good, the bad & the ugly things about owning one ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/cartog-epaper-cartog/royal+enfield+motorcycles+the+good+the+bad+the+ugly+things+about+owning+one-newsid-83579016

"We live in a country where we have to protest in order to get hung the rapists of innocent girls and women. From Nirbhaya to Asifa to many unknown girls in the country, who get raped, sexually molested and eve-teased every day. What do we expect from a government who punishes on killing a cow or a deer, but takes months and years to punish a rapist?This is India. India kills people for eating beef, for killing cows but doesn't care if someone rapes and kills our girls. India worships female goddesses and also molests and rapes a girl as young as a few days old.   Image Source Yes, we don't expect anything from the government or at least this mother doesn't, who bravely entered the mosque and beat a Maulvi to his sanity, who sexually molested her 8-yr-old daughter.This mother doesn't want her 8-yr old daughter to go through the same situation as the victim of Kathua rape case has faced, an incident which has shaken the whole nation with shame. And thus, fiercely entered the mosque along with her daughter, with a stick in her hand, and beat him insanely in front of everyone.Mother of a 8 years old girl entered into the mosque and beating the Molvi for molesting her daughter, proud of her 💕  The incident is of Pakistan, where other maulvis present in the mosque joined the mother and beat him up for his abhorrent act. The mother even encouraged her daughter to fight for herself by handing him the stick to beat her accused. The mother, indeed, taught him a good lesson.The video was shared by an internet user, after which it went viral, being re-shared by many people. But is this really the way justice should be served?She’s not hitting him hard enough in my opinion While many people also opinionated that everyone deserves a chance to prove themselves, even the Maulvi.No. But don't you think everyone deserves due process?  Kids that young wouldnt even know to make that up , come on use your head dude Everyone does deserve a chance to prove themselves, even the Maulvi in this case. But do you really think a girl as young as 8 years old could make up sinful stories as agonizing as that?© 2015 DailyHunt ",A Mother Enters The Mosque And Beat The Maulvi Who Molested Her 8-yr-old Daughter ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/laughingcolours+english-epaper-laughcole/a+mother+enters+the+mosque+and+beat+the+maulvi+who+molested+her+8+yr+old+daughter-newsid-85905776

"Every country has different laws and regulations. With the inception of internet in the 1990's and widespread use in the 2000s, every country has launched different laws that aim towards controlling the use of the internet. Some countries have different laws of using the internet for porn and other services.Let's take a look at some countries where Laws are different for using the internet.    The use of Porn is banned in Paksitan.Paskistan govt aims to censor all form of explicit material in the country that is accessed through the internet. The most shocking thing about this is that when Google released it's search data inb 2015, Pakistan was the country where most porn request generated. In India, porn is not completely banned but there are some rules and regulations for it.    In South Korea, the law for internet is aimed at young population aged less than 16 years. According to the Korean Law, playing video games for children of age less than 16 years from 12 O'Clock in the night to 6 O'clock in the morning is banned. This law was forced because school children ceased to be active in class and they were becoming a game addict. This law was changed in 2014 and children can play games if only parents permit.In India, there is no such restriction on video games.    There is a ban on keeping and watching online pornographic content. Not only this, you cannot keep any explicit material in any form like Magazines, books etc. If caught in South Korea with these materials, there is fine with two years sentence. This ban was placed in 2009.In India, Govt has blocked over 100 websites but otherwise it is not completely banned.    In Ethiopia, there is a ban on using internet services such as skype. There is a complete ban on VOIP services. Due to the ban of VOIP services, the people in Ethiopia cannot use services like Skype, Google Talk etc. These bans are justified by the nation as they are concerned with national security.In India, there is no such ban.    China is infamous for banning all the social networking websites that are popular on the internet. You will be surprised to know that you cannot access Facebook, Twitter in China. Not only this, there is no google in China! China has it's own search engines like WEIBO, BAIDU etc.In India, there could be widespread protests if govt even thinks of banning these sites. These websites are very popular in India.    In November 2015, due to concerns in National Security, Bangladesh Govt banned social networking websites like Twitter, Facebook, and even WhatsApp. After three weeks, this ban was lifted. In Bangladesh, there is a complete ban on keeping porn or explicit material in your possession. There is a provision of 10-year imprisonment for those who found guilty.In India, there is no such ban.    In both the countries, there is a ban on using Google Street View. This ban was launched when this google application was launched because the government of both the countries sees it as a privacy invasion of its citizens. It was lifted in 2010 in Greece and lifted in 2011 in Austria. Google Street View is still not available in these countries.In India, there is no ban on street view.    While in India, you can easily get Laser pointers in any market, in Europe, you could go to Police Station if you are found with one. There is a ban on Laser Pointers in many countries of Europe. This is because people started pointing lasers on Flights that were taking off. Due to security concerns, this ban was placed.    Pakistan is very much into censorship. Pakistan placed a ban on the services of Blackberry messengers and other activities. After some time, Pakistani Govt removed the ban on the services of Blackberry but encrypted them heavily. This was done in 2015.In India, services of Blackberry is opened without any encryption.    There is a total ban on internet in North Korea. According to the article 53 in North Korean Consitution, the govt has full control over the Internet. Only 4% of North Korean People have access to the Internet. In North Korea, there is also heavy restrictions of digital equipment you can have in your possession. In India, there is no such ban. In fact, Govt has launched schemes like Digital India. © 2015 DailyHunt ",Porn is Banned in Pakistan!

" She was always keen to pursue something of her own, which she did, and how! Read Menaka Bhandary's #PassionToPaycheck story below. Menaka Bhandary always knew she would become an entrepreneur. She displayed her precocity at 13, washing cars in her neighbourhood along with a group of friends. ""We were shocked at the number of cars we were washing in a day and ecstatic about the summer holiday pocket money we generated. Then later, at 16, I held a jewellery exhibition with a friend, where we used our networking skills and connected with friends of our parents, Bangalore Club members, ex-teachers and others to ensure that we make the sale a success,"" she recalls.She then worked for other businesses for about seven years before striking out on her own in December 2017 by launching BLOWN, a niche space dedicated to blow drying, cutting, colouring and styling hair as well as nail art and makeup.A Bangalorean at heart, Menaka, a Christ University Arts graduate, joined as a sales executive at Zela Health Clubs, where she moved up to managing the marketing department, and even ended up completing a certification as a spinning instructor. ""My second job was with the Narang Group where I headed marketing and events in south India. I [dabbled] all areas of the business, till my last stint with the Active Holiday Company, where I managed its business development.""Menaka had always been very passionate about the health and fitness space. ""My husband pushed me to listen to a podcast on Allie Webb's business, Drybar. I was instantly intrigued by the concept, and was already imagining the experience I would be delivering to my customers,"" explains Menaka, who decided to explore her options as an entrepreneur.She believes the grooming industry in India is growing exponentially, with each brand bringing its own USP to the market. The focus is not just the services but building and creating a revolutionary and holistic experience for the consumer.""That's exactly what Maneka did with BLOWN. She explains, ""Our team of experts is equipped to get you ready to go in a wink; and if you're in no hurry, we house a curated selection of international wines and cocktails to help you unwind. In other words, we love pampering people.""  However building a business isn't a cakewalk. Not having a beauty services background was her biggest challenge. ""When I approached technicians and stylists who worked with successful brands and invited them to join me, most of them laughed at the concept. They couldn't understand the inclusion of a wine bar at a salon,"" she says.But today, she is proud of what she's done with BLOWN. She believes it's all because of the passion she has had for entrepreneurship. ""One of the things I truly believe in is the ability to accept that you are learning something new every day. Everybody has to start somewhere. If you have something in your mind and have the zeal to execute it, you will find a way to make it work if it's important enough."" BLOWN is located in one of Bangalore's tony areas where there is tremendous competition. ""There are approximately 20 salons in the neighbourhood, so making a mark and finding the differentiating factor was a struggle. This venture being my very first business in a completely new industry, and with big players that customers swear by, meant that I had to deliver something truly exceptional and unique. It also meant that the quality of service that I provide had to be mind-blowing,"" says Menaka.But manage she did and more. ""Acquiring our wine license was a big challenge. I spent days in the Excise Department just trying to get an appointment with the person concerned.""And today, she's exactly where she wants to be: running a business successfully. She wants the company to expand further and have a major presence in every Indian city. She's also looking at extending BLOWN to other South-East Asian countries in the near future. ""In a male-dominated country like India, it's a huge struggle to run a business as a woman. But I've done everything I can to run my first business successfully, and will continue to do it,"" says this supremely confident young woman.

"Bollywood superstar Sridevi Kapoor, considered by many to be one of the biggest names in Hindi cinema, has died after suffering a cardiac arrest in Dubai, at only 54 years.Anyone who knew the veteran actress would tell you that she was extremely fit and her sudden demise came as a shock to many.Now, the point to be noted is that she suffered a cardiac arrest and not a heart attack.A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a section of the heart. If not re-opened quickly, that part of the heart starts dying.Cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning.It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat. The heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs and the person loses consciousness. Sridevi was rumoured to have gone under the knife several times. Botox treatments, lip-jobs, etc. she's done them all. While it is a personal choice, it seems these operations could've added to a higher stress level in her body, which culminated in a weak heart and eventually a cardiac arrest.© 2015 DailyHunt ",RIP Sridevi: How did the veteran actress suffer a cardiac arrest when she was fit as a fiddle? ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/rip+sridevi+how+did+the+veteran+actress+suffer+a+cardiac+arrest+when+she+was+fit+as+a+fiddle-newsid-82518061
"India woke up with the news that Dabangg of Bollywood, Salman Khan has been convicted by Jodhpur session court in 20-year-old blackbuck poaching case. Salman Khan was present at Jodhpur court along with co-stars Sonali Bendre, Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, and Neelam. The incident dates back to 1998 when Salman Khan along with his co-star had gone for hunting while shooting Hum Saath Saath Hai. Bishnois who heard gunshots at night have strongly claimed that Salman Khan who was in Gepsy killed two blackbucks. Blackbucks are considered sacred by the Bishnoi community.Well, soon after Salman Khan was convicted in the poaching case, Twitterati left no time for trolling Vivek Oberoi who has a tiff with Bhai!For those who aren't aware, let me tell you that Vivek Oberoi and Salman Khan are not on good terms ever since Aishwarya Rai's time.

"Asfina Bano the 8-year-old Kashmir girl who was brutally raped and murdered by 8 people in a temple.And now she awaits justice; only it is being delayed.In a shocking allegation, the lawyer of Asifa Bano has accused the president of the High Court Bar Association of harassment and threats for pleading the case of a minor girl.Deepika Singh Rajawat told a leading magazine that Bhupinder Singh Salathia tried to stop her from appearing in the court for Asifa.Jammu Bar Association has demanded that the case be transferred to CBI, saying they don't trust the Crime Branch of J&K police which has investigated the case and presented a charge sheet against seven accused. ""I am not a Jammu Bar member,"" Rajawat said. ""Knowing it well, Salathia tried to stop me and threatened me; he also used abusive language.""She said Salathia warned her that he has the means to stop her.""I have filed a complaint against him to the chief justice of the J&K High Court and the chief justice of the Supreme Court,"" she said. She said she has demanded protection as she doesn't feel safe.""I am thankful to the chief justice of J&K High Court who has taken cognizance of my complaint and asked the security wing of J&K High Court to ensure I remain safe whenever I appear in the court.""She said lawyers who are demanding a CBI probe into the case must understand that Crime Branch investigations were monitored by the High Court.""The Crime Branch investigated the case in a fair manner,"" Rajawat said. ""The High Court has passed orders in the case after periodically monitoring the investigations by the Crime Branch.""""We all know the evidence of the crime was destroyed so what is the CBI going to do now?"" she asked.""If the Crime Branch is not investigating the case properly, they (lawyers) should have said it when the matter was sub judice,"" she said.Rajawat said they could have raised objections before the High Court or complained to the chief minister that the case is not being investigated properly. ""Calling a bandh and harassing people and the litigants is not the way,"" she said, adding that the lawyers can fight it out in the court and prove their point rather hitting the roads.On April 9, she wrote on Facebook, ""Helpers in ladies bar room at trial courts have been directed not to offer me water by Jammu and Kashmir Bar Association.""Watch ANI's video below.Listen to Advocate Deepika Singh Rajawat who is representing Asifa on how she is being threatened by member of Jammu Bar Association.    When asked about the alleged threats, SD Jamwal, Inspector General of Police, Jammu, said, ""I've heard. But she [Rajawat] has not yet come to me or the SSP [Senior Superintendent of Police] about it. She needs to come to us if there is any such complaint."" Since no official complaint had been made, he said, the police had not given protection.""The lawyers who are on strike right now need to understand one thing - that this case was monitored by High Court. Knowing it well, still, they demand that CBI should investigate it,"" said Rajawat. ""We all know that at the initial stage, evidence was destroyed. What is the CBI going to do now?"" She added that the lawyers are aware of remedies and should have tackled this at the initial stages before the High Court or the chief minister, instead of taking to the roads or harassing people and litigants.""They are lawyers, they know how the cases go ahead, "" said Rajawat. ""They can come to the court, they can plead their case well. If they are innocent, if the crime branch has not investigated the case properly or fairly, they can prove themselves innocent in the court. Instead of taking to the roads and pleading for CBI inquiry. They need to wait, they need to have patience. They need to go to the court and say 'Look, sir, we are innocent. Please, sir, test me',"" she added.On Wednesday, the Jammu High Court Bar Association had called for a bandh in Jammu after the police registered an FIR against lawyers who tried to prevent them from filing a charge sheet in the Kathua rape and murder case. Before that, members of the Kathua Bar Association had staged a protest outside the district court in Jammu to prevent members of the state police from filing a charge sheet before the chief judicial magistrate.One of the lawyers said, ""We have been opposing this since day one."" They alleged that the investigation by state police was not fair, and demanded a probe by the CBI - the same demand was made by the Hindu Ekta Manch, a new group formed in Kathua in January 2018 to protest against the arrests of the accused in the case.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Asfina Bano's lawyer is threatened by colleagues ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/east+coast+daily+eng-epaper-eeastco/asfina+bano+s+lawyer+is+threatened+by+colleagues-newsid-85616929
" Alum benefits for Skin and hair problems. You have heard about the benefits of Alum from elders. Alum is also used in many skin problems. It not only makes you beautiful, but also helps to make your hair black and whiter your skin. Let us know about the advantages of Alum.  Alum for canker sores: Alum powder is used to treat canker sores easily.Just place a pinch of alum powder on top of the sore and leave it for 30 seconds. Wash it off thoroughly. Repeat this for 2-3 times daily till the canker sores go off. You will get complete cure mostly within 3 days.  Alum for dark circles: Many commercial brands started using alum powder in their product for curing dark circles. You can mix a pinch of alum powder with water and apply it on the dark circles. Take care not to apply on the eye. Please do it carefully.  Bleeding cuts: A few research has shown that this one even has the ability to deal with the bleeding cuts. You are able to spread the alum residue on such cuts to prevent an additional loss of blood. But here, remember that in case your cut is just too deep and also the bleeding is simply not stopping, then you'll need some professional medical help. And so, during that time, don't just depend on an alum residue.  Alum for Hair Removal: Alum is traditionally used for hair removal. Women in historical ages utilized alum for removing unwanted facial hairs just like upper lip hair. Mix 1/2 tsp of alum powder along with 1 tsp of rose water and keep it ready. Adjust the amount of alum powder as well as water as needed. The ratio of alum powder to rose water is 1:2 roughly. Once hair is removed or even waxing is completed, use the alum mixture on the face or even the place where you would like the facial hairs to be removed. Let it rest for 20 minutes. If you feel that the mix gets dried up, you are able to sprinkle rose water on it to help keep it on more time. Clean thoroughly and pat the face dry. This can be done on your hands and legs too. Use moisturizer after pat drying to keep the area moisturized. Regular coconut oil can be used as moisturizing. Try not to apply around the eye as well as surrounding areas.  Alum for Body Odor: Once your body releases sweat, the food compounds in sweat attract bacteria that leave uncomfortable smell right after feeding on these compounds. Use alum block on pre-washed arms on alternative days. Anti-bacterial as well as germ killing qualities living in alum will combat and restrain bacterial infection.  © 2015 DailyHunt ",Alum benefits for skin and hair problems ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/daily+post-epaper-dpost/alum+benefits+for+skin+and+hair+problems-newsid-71735226
"You must have heard people using mustard oil in cooking, just like coconut oil. Well, you would be surprised to know that it is used for moisturizing the skin and chapped lips. The only difference is, mustard oil is applied before taking a shower, unlike all other essential and natural oils that are used after taking a shower. Mostly used by the people residing in the eastern part of India, the oil is great for digestion, getting rid of sore joints, arthiritis and pains.But applying it in the navel area has the following benefits:    Mustard oil works both externally and internally on your digestive system if applied in the belly button.If you have a troubled bowel, this is the ultimate remedy for you. All you have to do is take a few drops of mustard oil and apply it around the belly button, rubbing it all around the area in a circular motion. The external massage helps in releasing gastric juice and bile juice from spleen and liver. The intestines also get stimulated, activating the excretory system and thereby helping in digestion and clearing of your body.     Winters are arriving and your lips are the best indications of that. Chapped and dry lips are a thing of the past if you are in the habit of applying mustard oil in your belly button. Mustard oil acts as a great moisturizer. This also reduces the darkness of the lips with regular use.

Applying mustard oil externally in a circular motion everyday before going to bed at night can fight a number of diseases too. So, if you have an injury that is not healing right, applying mustard oil can help. Just add two to three drops of mustard oil and apply it in the effected area until the infection heals.   Applying mustard oil in he naval removes dirt. Most often tham not, we forget to nurture our belly buttons because it lies in the most inaccessible area of the body. However, we forget that it is located in the most essential area, which has all the vital organs.

"Confessions by prostitutes - Prostitution in India is a big ""No-No"" in the eyes of the Indian Law which is something I am never able to understand.Who doesn't know about the red-light areas that exist in India?What are the able to do about them?The worst part of this scenario is that most of the women in India are forced into prostitution since a young age as they grow up; they have no other choice then to continue with that for money as there is literally no escape from the ""sex-market"" industry like that. A lot of women in India have no other choice other than joining the prostitution industry for earning money because a lot of problems which they have to go through.It's nothing as we assume it to be because the dark side of this market is worse than we can imagine. Here are some of the confessions by prostitutes and the agony of their lives will make your heart fall apart.Confessions by prostitutes - :I was forced into prostitution because I belonged to the third gender. My family chucked me out of their house because according to them I was bringing a bad name to their family. I had no other option than to leave my house. I met a man once and he said that he'll give me money and food only if I agree to do what he says. As I had been hungry since 3 days I agreed. He did everything that he could have done with a sex-worker. I felt a lot of pain but became numb after sometime. He took me to a place where there were many like me. Since then I have been a part of the sex market in India. :I was 11 years old when my parents sold me to a man for five thousand rupees as my father was in debt. The man took me a dingy looking place full of unpleasant women and some men. I couldn't understand anything that time. I was made to sit down in one of the small rooms which gave me a hint that something wasn't right. A lady came to me saying that wear these clothes and be ready for your first customer. I did as she said as she was really scary and angry. After some time I saw a middle aged man coming towards me. He pulled me closer and banged me on the bed. He got on the top of me and started removing my clothes. I shouted and he slapped me, which made me keep quite. He got into me and crying was the only option I had. I kept on crying in pain and he left after some time after finishing with what he wanted to do. I became numb since that day and now I am a part of the prostitution market.   :I have been into prostitution from around 15 years and these years have been the worst days of my life. If we are not feeling well and we cannot do our job even for a single day, we are thrashed by our mistress for being unproductive even for a day. No matter what we have to complete the daily job hours of us. I even have a daughter but I have sent her to an NGO where they are taking care of her education just because I don't want to put even the shadow of this hell on her and that is why I keep her away from all this. I go to see her at times but secretly, she doesn't know I am her mother. She meets me as a visitor and that's heartbreaking. Nonetheless I don't even know who her father is.    I am a prostitute from Kolkata and was brought here after I was kidnapped from a market when I was 13 years old. I was really out of control as I knew why they brought me to a place like that. I was screaming and crying because of which the mistress started beating me with a belt. She later gave me shocks with a wire to numb me as one of her customers was waiting. I was still not letting anyone close to me. She then tore of my clothes and dropped honey on my vagina after which she left ant on it. They started biting me and after sometime I actually became numb. She made me take a shower and that's when I got the first man on my body. Later that day I got 12 different men on me. The main was immense but I just forgot how to react.  These are confessions by prostitutes - some of the examples of the pain and agony prostitutes are made to go through. People often use their names or profession as an insult but the realities are really harsh on them which definitely goes unnoticed.© 2015 DailyHunt ","These Confessions By Indian Prostitutes About The ""Sex-Market"" Will Rip Your Heart Apart ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/youngisthan-epaper-youngeng/these+confessions+by+indian+prostitutes+about+the+sex+market+will+rip+your+heart+apart-newsid-69978766

"JAIPUR: A girl, aged around 21-year-old recognized as Shikha Tiwari, who used to work as a disc jockey (DJ) at a Mumbai hotel, was detained by the special operations group (SOG) of the state police for purportedly blackmailing and confining a city-based hair transplant specialist in a fake rape case in December a year ago.The SOG has been following her since December 2016 when her name sprung up after sleuths busted a honeytrap racket which was into coercing specialists, developers and others in the city.She had blackmailed the specialist and held up a FIR against him, bringing about the previous burning through 78 days in prison before being absolved.On December 24, 2016, the SOG had busted the blackmailing racket which had extorted many men with false rape charges and fleeced them.

"  China appears to be very touchy on the Arunachal issue to ascertain its claim on Tibet. China has said time and again that it will nominate the next Dalai Lama who will toe the Chinese line and will agree that Tibet is a part of China. So the present Dalai Lama does not exactly fit the bill for China. Tibetans all across the world revere him as their spiritual leader and cultural icon. The pathological hatred of China for Dalai Lama, who virtually challenges the former's whims and fancy has root in histories.      Dalai Lama may be a celebrated holy figure across the globe but he is a much hated trouble maker in China which considers him a ""wolf in holy robe"" for challenging the soverignity of China by asking for freedom.But Dalai Lama says that all he is asking for is autonomy to sustain and protect Tibetans' culture and religion. Seen as a rebel who initiated a rebellion against China in Tibet in 1959 after which he sought a political asylum in India.    The monastery in Tawang was built in 1681 by the Tibetan lama Lodre Gyasto complying with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama Nagwang Lobsang. Dalai Lama is the inheritor of the same order and is therefore despised by China. China wants its own choosen Dalai Lama on the holy seat.   Though Dalai Lama openly says that he has never demanded for a complete independence from China, the latter feels that he has not given up his dream of a 'Greater Tibet'  and it sees Dalai Lama's global tours as strategies to make lobby and build pressure groups therefore pushing for his political goals. What adds fuel to the fire is the fact that Dalai Lama mostly meets world leaders who are not very good friends of China-- for example the American President and for that matter, even the Indian leaders.   Dalai Lama won the Nobel Prize for peace in 1989 further isolating China in the eyes of the world and further putting pressure on it through celebrity endorsements like that of Richard Gere. So indirectly it is the good peace-loving humble Dalai Lama vs the power hungry and strong China. China hates this positioning.   For China Tibet is a core sensitive issue. And China finds it insulting when Dalai Lama is accorded a VIP treatment akin to the head of a state and it cahllenges China's soverighmity. The words such as 'freedom' and 'human rights' used by Dalai Lama and his followers to win sympathy world-over is highly objectionable to China. And for India the issue of Tibet and Dalai Lama both  are means to settle scores with China and keep its reins in hand.  © 2015 DailyHunt ",Why exactly China hates Dalai Lama: Know the facts ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/news24online-epaper-newsonline/why+exactly+china+hates+dalai+lama+know+the+facts-newsid-65988612
" Lord Shiva which is a 'Hindi' term has originated from a beautiful concept of (Shav = Dead, and E = Energy). It means when energy flows into the dead body; it starts to live, hence called as Shiva. Which only denotes, we're all born Shivas.Shiva is one of the most important God in Hinduism and the crucial one in the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh (another name of Shiva) who represent Creation, Preservation, and Destruction respectively.Shiva is a destroyer, not only the destroyer of the establishment when the judgment day comes but also the destroyer of misery and hurdles in life. It is not me who is saying this, but everything which you'll read in this story is an excerpt from a beautiful mythological book, ""Dev Se Mahadev"" by author Aakash Kailash Vijayvargiya.Coming from a renowned political background in Indore, India, Aakash read the entire 'Shivpuran' to understand Shiva as religion, which is known as 'Shiva Dharma'. He also researched well on the counterpart of mythology, science, to connect the both and bring in forth a concept which helps people understand different types of laws of 'Shiva Karma' to follow in their lives to attain the highest form of existence. Have a look! The first law of Shiva Karma is the truth. This law asks the followers to follow the path of truth, justice and being true to themselves and those who are around. Remember the dishonesty, and false deeds may prevail the small battles, but the truth always wins the war.A single person cannot possess the knowledge of everything, but everyone may possess the knowledge of something. We should find that seed of knowledge within us, and then do all our karma around it.No matter what life you're living, at what place you are; if your happiness depends on the materialistic things you own, then happiness is an illusion for you, and it'll be gone with that thing. The third law of Shiva Karma asks believers not to attach their happiness to earthly things.The world we're living in is growing more self-obsessed. Everyone is worried about their happiness and doesn't care if people around them are happy or not. However, the real happiness is beyond limits, and it could be felt only when we have found the seed of knowledge within us, and we're truthful with others and ourselves. Remember, happiness comes from within, not outside.If you may have noticed a happy person around you, you'll see that the illusion does not control them. You put them in any situation at any place; they'll be the same calm and content in their mind. So, the fifth and one of the most fundamental laws of Shiva Karma is practicing to be formless like water.When our mind is at peace with heart, and we walk on the path of self-realization, all our senses come together to work in a proper synchronization. When you achieve this state in your physical form, the feeling you get is incomparable.With these laws of Shiva Karma, you achieve the englightement. The highest form of existence for a human. In this state of mind, you attain self-realization along with the proper understanding of nature and reality.Enlightenment is the final state, and it can be achieved in this life only, without sacrificing the domestic life.Aakash shares that ""Shiva Dharma is not a religion, but the way of life. It's a process to attain everything that you ever need in your life."" To spread the awareness among people and promote the positive way of life in India, Aakash is working day and night on the concept of reciting '108 Om Chants'. Despite busy political schedules, Aakash takes out time to visit at least one 'Om Chant' event every single day without a miss, where people from all walks of life come together and meditate.That's all, folks!© 2015 DailyHunt ",7 Laws Of Shiva Karma By Lord Shiva That'll Change Your Life ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/7+laws+of+shiva+karma+by+lord+shiva+that+ll+change+your+life-newsid-73392515

"India never ceases to amaze. The way we respect, worship, adore, honour our women folk is exemplary in the world. Everybody in the world now knows how despite India having the developed nation tag is still underdeveloped in its outlook towards women. Every now and then arises a story which pushes women and the country back into the dark ages.Here is one such story from a village in Madhya Pradesh. Here women are given out on rent to the richest man or the upper class male who cannot find a partner. The woman is supplied as wife for a month or for yearly rental basis. The words immediately signify how women have been actively reduced to an inanimate object of barter or commerce.Called Dhadeecha Pratha in the Shivpuri district of MP, the practice involves signing over a woman for lease on a stamp paper. With the help of these stamp deeds worth Rs 10, Rs 100, women are exchanged to the next man in need. There is a market here where girls are made to stand in the name of the custom. Then the men decide the price of the girl of their choice.So the woman has a new husband after her contract ends. The higher the rental amount, the longer the period she gets to stay with one man.This practice is not limited to MP but has been reported in Gujarat as well. Due to scarcity of women largely due to female infanticide, there has been a case where a Gujarati farm labourer Atta Prajapati leased his wife Laxmi to a wealthy zamindar for a month. The exchange earned him 10 times his monthly salary - Rs 8000. The deal needs her to live with the man and share his bed and take care of the family as well. This has become a lucrative business opportunity for many villagers in the Gujarat-MP belt. In some cases the women are sold for prices as low as Rs 500, while in some other their families are paid up to Rs 50,000 for marrying their daughters to men from certain communities.Apart from the dwindling female population here. touts or middlemen who encourage such dealings also prey on the woman's family's poverty. The tribal families are known to be involved in such practices. No action has been taken because none comes forward to complain, say the police, all the while acknowledging the existence of such a practice.© 2015 DailyHunt ",This Indian village practices a custom of giving wives on rent! ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/this+indian+village+practices+a+custom+of+giving+wives+on+rent-newsid-76197889

"   They say once bitten, twice shy - for Aditya and Zoya, love betrayed them the first time around, will they learn to fall in love again? With the perfect amalgamation of romance, drama, and mystery - this riveting plot features some of the most loved faces of Indian Television with Jennifer Winget as Zoya, Harshad Chopda as Aditya, Sehban Azim as Yash (Zoya's Husband) and Namita Dubey essaying the role of Pooja (Aditya's Wife). Speaking about being a part of the anticipated show, Jennifer Winget who plays Zoya said, ""The first time I heard the narration for the show, I had tears in my eyes; a show like Bepannaah comes your way rarely and I am ecstatic to be a part of it. My character Zoya is a sweet, polite young lady who has always led a very sheltered life and has always been dependent on the men in her life. How her life turns upside down in a flash is baffling, to say the least. I'm having a blast shooting with Harshad and Sehban. I'm sure viewers will love our chemistry.""   Harshad Chopda who essays the character of Aditya says, ""I am returning to television after a hiatus and I was consciously waiting to pick the right story. Bepannaah's core concept and my director Aniruddha Sir and DOP Deepak Sir were the major influencers in this case; Jennifer and I hit off as soon as we met. I'm sure it will be exciting for the audience to see us together onscreen.""   Sehban Azim who plays Zoya's husband- Yash on the show said, ""Bepannaah is a show that has been in the making for a while now. The detailing for every character, be it the look, the dialogues, the treatment - all of it has been given close attention to and its brilliance shows in every scene we do. I cannot thank the channel and the creators of the show enough, for making me a part of this stunning piece of fiction"".    Namita Dubey, who plays Aditya's wife Pooja in the show said, ""We are working with the best team on television today - both in front of the camera and behind it. The audience's response to the promo has been great and I hope and pray that it gets better and bigger as the show progresses.""     © 2015 DailyHunt ",Bepannaah is an intriguing love story of Zoya and Aditya ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/mumbai+live+english-epaper-mliveng/bepannaah+is+an+intriguing+love+story+of+zoya+and+aditya-newsid-83747840

" SPONSORED The Eskimo kiss. The French kiss. The Butterfly kiss. The Spiderman kiss. There's also the Lingering kiss, and the Lizard kiss. This list is virtually neverending. Still, I'd add on this kiss-kitty, where we have The Foot Popping Kiss. I bet you must've witnessed atleast one such kiss on the screen if you've never experienced it personally. So, what's all the fuss around it? Well, when a guy is obsessed kissing his girl's luscious lips, she may tend to have one of her feet raised up in the air. To science's surprise, there seems to be no particular reason why this happens, and so, we decided to dive into this amorous dilemma and find out why some girls react the way while kissing.Here you go.In the Hollywood movie, 'The Princess Diaries' (2001), Queen Clarisse Renaldi teaches Mia Thermopolis how to behave exactly like a princess in the daily life.Does it mean every girl walking around has been taught by someone or by the internet that a kiss feels best only when you raise one of the feet up in the air?I doubt, and so do you, I am sure. So let's first see what all this craze is about.""You know in old films whenever a girl would get seriously kissed, her foot would kind of - pop.""In the same 2001 movie, Mia talks about how an ideal kiss would be. This gave millions of girls their kiss goals.And then, a better reason to follow the trend came up.Yeah, The Foot Popping Kiss (which was already famous) came back in the news two years ago when Taylor Swift's picture of her kiss with Calvin surfaced. The duo went to Bahamas Beach for vacations, and these pictures rocked the summers of 2016. Among the other images, we could see Taylor in a swimsuit, both of them enjoying a water trampoline and jet ski kayaks. But the one that caught the most attention was the one above.  ""It can be purely out of instinct and could signal towards the enjoyment that a female is feeling while indulging in it. Our body reacts to every single thing that happens with it, and this can also be the way a female body responds with a reflex action.""This one's tricky but closer to the truth. If you know about the concept of Centre of Gravity (The total weight of a body that has mass concentrates at one point), you'll agree that when a female's body bends backward to as she indulges in a kiss (which happens generally), that gravity of hers shifts too. Therefore, a foot sticks out in the form of a compensatory action to maintain the body's balance.Picture dinosaurs. Or cats. They all use their tails to maintain balance when in movement.This one's funny. In many countries, showing an intimate scene in a movie where lips interlock is considered quite offensive and NSFW in nature. Many a time, makers use relevant props through smart tricks like these to denote a similar situation- 1) Moving flowers are used to show a lip kiss.2) Only the leg part where the female's foot rises to express an intimate situation.3) They show their silhouettes as kissing each other...and many others. Many couples run behind the idea of being an 'ideal' couple. They follow everything that is thought to be quintessential. Considering the popularity this style has, many couples incline on it just to feel that they're doing it in the best possible way.Also, if a photographer captures them in the act, they turn popular as well.Popular things and culture are always surrounded by myths too. This one's simple. The statement minced into a question goes as- ""Would you like to see a guy's foot popping out? I bet, you don't. That might not please most eyes. So, let this be a girl's job.""  - I hope feminists out there are not offended. I believe in the idea of equality, trust me. Remember the very very famous  You can read about it on Wikipedia, and I believe many couples try this iconic pose for the sake of repeating history.  For the sake of experimenting, one can always go beyond the general idea of kissing.I hope you share this story.Write to me on sorrabruvissa@gmail.com for suggestions.

"It seems that Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the Vice-Presidential candidate of the Opposition has a critic within his own family. Shrikrishna Kulkarni, the grandson of Ramdas Gandhi and the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, had written a letter to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi telling him to stop fooling people in the name of Mahatma Gandhi and to Gopalkrishna Gandhi to question his endorsement of Congress.In the letter, he wrote how most of the members of the Gandhi family had moved on from Mahatma Gandhi's assassination, but the current crop of Congress top brass are still harping on history.""My humble suggestion, you folks who own Congress and your goof self should move on and quit milking the name Gandhi and this issue for your selfish benefits,"" he said.""To keep harping that the RSS killed Gandhi is akin to saying the Tamils killed your father, which would be a petty falsehood isn't it? A couple of guys don't make for a community.""In the letter, he also asked Rahul Gandhi to stop fooling people.    In another letter addressed to his uncle Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Kulkarni said that he was disappointed to see him filing for Vice-Presidential candidature flanked this family of dynastic politics. He stated that this family does not deserve to be linked with anything to do with Mahatma Gandhi.He also said that Gandhiji committed a mistake by appointing Jawaharlal Nehru the Prime Minister over Sardar Vallabhai Patel. He said that the progeny of Nehru had made a mockery of all that Gandhiji stood for and he cannot bear to see it happen anymore.      © 2015 DailyHunt ","Mahatma's great-grandson disappointed with Gopalkrishna Gandhi, tells Rahul to stop fooling people ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/mahatma+s+great+grandson+disappointed+with+gopalkrishna+gandhi+tells+rahul+to+stop+fooling+people-newsid-71047546

"Reasons girls dump boys - Are you in a relationship and spend most of the time to please her?If yes, then this is a sign that you might get dumped by the girlfriend. So, stop taking things for granted and be a responsible person. The girls expect a little more than usual. But, that doesn't allow you to be calm all the time. In fact, the girls dump boys who are less involved in the relationship.Thus, pull up your socks and get ready to be there for her whenever she needs. This caring attitude towards the girlfriend will make her feel secure. Wait. Because this one gesture won't you secure in the relationship.There are many other reasons girls dump boys. According to the survey published in the Men's Health magazine, 54 percent of the women take a week's time to decide about dumping the boyfriend. This clearly shows that moving out of a relationship is not as easy as it looks. Thus, try to be an active boyfriend rather than being an excuse-giver all the time.    This is the first and the foremost reason why girls dump boys. The eye contact is the best way to make love. In fact, you should always look into her eyes during the conversations. As this gesture makes her feel loved and cared. But, that doesn't allow you to stare her. The continuous staring can make her feel uncomfortable and annoyed sometimes. So, fall in love with your girlfriend during the conversations and keep the relationship going.    The girlfriends expect you to be a good listener. But, your involvement with the phone more than her is not a good habit. This activity makes her feel less important. Thus, she feels like you are not on her priority list and gets enough reason to call off the relationship.    Having a caring partner is a common expectation. But, not being by her side when she is emotionally weak shows how careless you are. This reflection of your personality disheartens her. So, be cautious and get involved in her life when she needs you the most. As a genuinely loving partner is the one who stands with you during the tough times. Therefore, the careless attitude of a boyfriend is one reason why girls dump boys.    The relationship works on the basis of trust and love. Thus, giving excuses for not making up for a party or any other occasion can make her really upset. Also, canceling the planned vacations or a dinner date with an unreal excuse is the worst thing to do in a relationship. As this makes your girlfriend feel like you are not interested in being committed. This is one of the top reasons why girls dump boys.    Every relationship needs time and your indulgence in work is not allowing this to happen. Thus, your girlfriend is likely to feel ignored and sidelined. Remember, the girls never like to be less prioritized. As a result, she raises the bar and goes for another guy. So, balance your work and love life. As too much of indulgence in work is one reason why girls dump boys.    The future planning makes a girl feel secure and important. But, your idea to enjoy life as it comes can disappoint her. Also, she may feel like you are not sure about continuing this relationship. Thus, she takes a call and leaves you. Your idea of living the moment is likely to ruin the relationship. The zero future planning is a reason why girls dump boys often.    You must have a say in the relationship. But, offering pieces of advice on how to deal with situations such as work stress, family issue or about relaxing can annoy her. Also, this makes you look super-intelligent and portrays her as dumb. So, stop being the advisor.    There are a number of messaging apps available today. But, this doesn't mean you should stop calling your girlfriend. Make a couple of calls to her in a day rather than texting her all the time. A ringing cell phone grabs more attention than a message tone. As a result, she replies in time but leaving a message can make you wait. This ignites misunderstanding that result in a fight. Thus, stop texting and start calling her. The use of messaging app too much is a reason why girls dump boys.    Do get a hair and nails cut every week. Also, make sure that your socks don't stink. In fact, no girl wants to be with an unhygienic person. This is also a reason why girls dump boys.    The girls never like to be overshadowed. Thus, stop saying I am this and that. As these things reflect how selfish you are. Also, it shows that the girl only has looks and no brain. So, stop making her feel like a zero else be ready to get dumped.    The aggressive nature can cost you the relationship. As getting into a fight anytime is something your girl will not appreciate. Also, it grabs unnecessary attention which makes her uncomfortable. So, stop being rude else you will be listed as a guy dumped by a girl.    Never make her feel the pain from the past. The girls prefer to be happy with the present. Thus, digging her past is a disrespectful activity. Also, this describes your mindset and thought process. So, be cautious with what you say. This is because you might not know the real reasons for her breakup from the past. Therefore, this activity can make her ditch you.Reasons girls dump boys - All these reasons are enough to understand what not to do in a relationship. So, stay humble, caring and loving towards your girlfriend. This will save you from being dumped by a girl.© 2015 DailyHunt ",12 Reasons Why Girls Dump Boys ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/youngisthan-epaper-youngeng/12+reasons+why+girls+dump+boys-newsid-77072648

"New Delhi, Jan 15: The government employees of Jammu and Kashmir state will receive benefits under the 7th Pay Commission or 7th CPC from April 1, announced the state Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu on Friday. The 7th Pay Commission recommendations will also be implemented retrospectively from January 2016 in Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, Finance Ministry has reportedly ruled out the possibility of a hike in minimum pay for the top and middle-level employees of central government beyond the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation.""I am committed to implementing 7th Pay Commission recommendations from April 1, 2018,"" Haseeb Drabu told the Assembly while presenting his fourth budget.He also announced the release of 1 per cent Dearness Allowance for government employees retrospectively from July 1 last year. The state government employees termed the announcement over the implementation of 7th Pay Commission's recommendations as 'a victory without war'. ""In general, it is the employee-friendly budget and we are thankful to the government for announcing the 7th Pay Commission. For us, it is a victory without war,"" Abdul Qayoom Wani, president of the Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC), told a Kashmir-based newspaper. Wani added that the employees were readying themselves to hit the streets if the government wouldn't have announced the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission.As far as a hike in minimum pay and fitment factor beyond the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for the central government employees is concerned, there is no clarity. There would be no hike in minimum pay beyond the recommendation of the 7th Pay Commission for the top and middle-level employees of the central government, a Sen Times report said quoting a top Finance Ministry official.""They will never be given hike in pay matrix above the 7th Pay Commission's recommendation because they do not need it,"" the official said. ""The government have already reviewed the salaries and perks of the central government above the pay matrix level 5 and decided they do not need higher pay matrix levels,"" he added. The central government employees have been asking to raise minimum pay to Rs 26,000 and fitment factor 3.68 times from 2.57 times.The government had approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission on a hike in salary of central government employees in June 2016. The 7th Pay Commission had recommended a 14.27 percent hike in basic pay, raising minimum pay from Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000 month.

"While global mobile penetration is on the rise, Asia-Pacific has become the biggest contributor to the growth in the global numbers. American research firm Forrester predicted over 5.5 billion or 70% of the world's population would have a mobile by 2022, a rise of nearly 100% from 2008. The jump would especially be due to the increasing mobile adoption in India and China. Forrester said the number of global smartphone users is expected to hit 3.8 billion by 2022.The number would cross ""the 50% mark for smartphone penetration by population in 2017, and reaching 66% by 2022."" About 94% of the smartphone users currently have Android or iOS. By 2017-end, Android would have 73% of the market share while Apple would capture 21% and Windows 4%. According to the data recently released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the number of mobile phone users has crossed the one billion subscribers' mark. Except for Bihar (54%) and Assam (56%), all Indian states have more than 60% mobile penetration.India currently has more than 300 million smartphone users thanks to the fast smartphone adoption. While GSM technology dominated the mobile subscriptions in 2016, LTE and WCDMA/HSPA are forecast to account for 85% of the subscriptions by 2022. The 5G technology, expected to be deployed in 2022, is predicted to represent around 0.2% of the subscriptions by the year 2022. According to Forrester: ""Large-screen smartphones are contributing to the decline in tablet users: In metro China and India, 65% and 62% of online adult smartphone users, respectively, have a screen size between 5.0 and 6.0 inch.""Globally, the number of tablet purchases would decline over the next five years. The total tablet user base would decrease at 1.1% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) by 2022, plummeting to 579 million in 2022 compared to 2016's 615 million. While the number of consumer-owned tablets would come down at 3.3% CAGR by 2022, that of business-owned tablets would grow at 6.9% CAGR. Another recent report highlighted how Asia-Pacific's mobile industry would contribute to the growth of the region's economy and social development by 2020. The region has been witnessing a dramatic shift to high-speed mobile networks, thanks to the 3G and 4G technologies. Also, Asian mobile operators are set to be among the first ones in the world to commercially launch 5G networks before 2020. © 2015 DailyHunt ","5.5 billion mobile users by 2022, India to lead ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/newsbytes-epaper-newbyt/5+5+billion+mobile+users+by+2022+india+to+lead-newsid-70512195
"Durex India, which claims to be the best condom brand in India, has tweeted that 95 percent of men in India do not use condoms. This has led to a campaign #HateCondoms and believe me; this is the topmost trending hashtag on Twitter. It is said that the percentage is based on the findings of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).What’s happening India? 95% of Indians don’t use condoms! We’d love to know why? But do people really hate condoms? Or was the company speaking about people not using the Durex condoms?The Twitterati expressed mixed reactions to this finding. While many found it difficult to believe the numbers, others gave reasons, why men do not like wearing condoms.However, according to Business Standard report based on the findings of the NFHS in 2017, the use of contraceptive pills and condoms has risen in India even as there has been a decline in adopting overall family planning methods. The statistics by NFHS stated that between the previous survey, 10 years ago, and now, the use of pills has risen to 4.1 percent from 3.1 percent, and that of condoms to 5.6 percent from 5.2 percent.So, what has happened to Indian men in 2018?On the other hand, use of contraceptives by women has gone up to 54%. This might provide some answers to why the number of men using condoms has come down.Men don't like compromising on the sexual pleasures but can order their women to use contraceptives? Is this what's happening? Maybe there is need for a new hashtag #HateCondomsButLoveContraceptives? Hey does Condoms take the amazing feeling of sex away? I don't think so. Then why so  ?  Mainly because of this fact, you may now think of condoms to be as essential as guns while in combat.   I  because 40 rs diye condom ke or fatt bhi gaya BC 72 hours wali tablet ke 80 rs or lag gaye🙄😑  LOL 95% of Indians don't wear condoms coz it's like chewing on an Eclairs with the wrapper on. But seriously, why do people ?   I don't believe that 95% of Indians don't use or  I mean look at the Valentine's day shopping   So much so even Priyanka Gandhi fan page too Tweeted on #HateCondoms  Well-wisher cronies of BJP including Chhota Modi, Mehul Bhai and Jatin Mehta left us for paying higher EMIs and increased rates of interest.

"There is no looking back now!Bollywood is what means entertainment to an Indian! The Hindi film industry is known the world over, for its stars, for the talent in them and the high glamour quotient of the celebs. Bollywood has surely come a long way, from the first silent film in 1913 to the present where entertainment drives the audience.Some of the indomitable pairs like SRK-Karan Johar, SRK-Yash Johar, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan-Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Ajay Devgn-Rohit Shetty, are the pride of this list. This combination plays an important role in leading to the success of a film, but there is no undermining the other contributors, ranging from cameramen to producers to spot boys who try their very best to make a movie, a hit.Another aspect of this piece is the importance of connections that matters a lot in Bollywood. Here we are with a compilation of actor-director pairs who have given memorable and entertaining films together. These pairs continue to be great friends off-screen and this maybe something that has brought them success!The pretty obvious and deserving the first spot on the list, this friend cum actor-director duo has enthralled the audience with their right out-of-the-book portrayal of romance. In movies such as 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' to 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' to 'Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna' and 'My Name Is Khan'. The pair has also delivered dark plots, something beyond their comfort zone of lovey-dovey films! David Dhawan, the director who has been known for his knack of directing fun filled, humour driven films with the desi touch of Bollywood, is best paired with Govinda. They have together made the audience roll on the floor laughing, in more than 16 ventures. Although the duo's charm lasted only till the early 2000s, we hope that they reunite to bring those natural peals of laughter back on our faces! Can't keep myself from mentioning my personal favourite, ""Haseena Maan Jaayegi""!Imtiaz Ali is a modern filmmaker who has tugged right at the heartstrings on the Indian millennials. In 'Jab We Met', he was so bang-on that the Indian youth could not keep itself from thronging the theatres. When the two young bloods, Ranbir and Imtiaz joined hands, we were blessed with the modern fables of 'Tamasha' and 'Rockstar'. We are looking out for many more of these endearing and relatable flicks.This actor-director pair gave the audience an amalgamation of Indian culture and die-hard love. In movies like, 'Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' and 'Devdas', we were enticed by the aesthetics of Sanjay and the 'beauty queen', Aishwarya. But their latest collaboration in 'Guzaarish', was not well. The two have given films of a folk genre to their audience.Hrithik debuted in the Hindi film industry with his dad's 'Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai' and grabbed attention to be soon called as the Greek God, for his sharp looks. Then came in the hits like 'Koi... Mil Gaya' and 'Krrish' series, which established them as a great pair in the minds of the people. They have together delivered blockbusters and have a cent percent success rate.Films like 'Darr', 'Dil To Pagal Hai', 'Veer-Zaara', which have been masterpieces by this talented duo, are etched in our hearts for their stories and portrayal. The acting, the direction, the plot, they were one of the best amalgamations, to woo the moviegoers. Both of them have granted each other success, and the audience is never bored of watching their films, again and again.This pair gave us some timeless and eternally romantic films for the audience. Their chemistry clicked at the right moment and we were lucky to have them in nearly 14 films together, with these- 'Shree 420', 'Anari', 'Andaz' and 'Barsaat', as unforgettable masterpieces.'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (1995), the most-loved film of Shah Rukh's career, was directed by none other than Aditya Chopra, also his directorial venture. This film still lingers in the heart of every 90s kid. And since then, as they say, the rest is history, we had blockbusters like, 'Mohabbatein' and 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi', which were an epitome of love and romance. The Badshah and the 'silent genius' are beyond superb when they are together.Kabir Khan has the forte of directing films on serious issues and still turning them into drama. Apt examples are 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan', 'Ek Tha Tiger' among many others. But these films were great crowd attractions while addressing some serious plots. Well executed, well crafted and brought out in the best envelope of emotions, direction and cinematography, Kabir Khan's films are not the ones one can leave in the middle! But, alas, the latest one, 'Tubelight' failed to carry forward that charm. The camaraderie began in 2013 with the dark love drama, 'Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela' and has matured with 'Bajirao Mastani' to entice us soon on 17 November 2017, with 'Padmavati'. All of them, having the trio, Ranveer-Deepika-Sanjay! These movies created ripples with their historical storylines, elaborate sets and loaded star cast. We cannot wait to start the countdown for Padmavati, fascinated by their performances together.We could not keep ourselves from including this rocking duo on our list here. From contemporary entertainers like 'Love Aaj Kal', 'Cocktail' to 'Tamasha', we have seen both talents get polished and grow over the years. Giving the Indian audience flavours of love and friendship, we adore this pair and desperately wish to see more of them together.My favourite of all, Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani have together given some eye-opening films to the Indian audience. Not to forget some important life lessons from the flicks like 'PK' and '3 Idiots'. Let me confess here that the audience is anticipating more of these from you, guys! Are there any on the cards? I want to hear a YES!Rohit Shetty, known for his humorous action packed movies, delivered it best with the veteran actor, Ajay Devgn. We cannot forget them in the Golmaal series, then came the record-breaking Singham and Bol Bachchan, which made marks on the minds of the audience as signature Rohit Shetty films. The flying, stumbling-over-each-other cars scene is an inescapable sight in his films, sometimes making us recognise the movie with the scene!Two of my favs from Bollywood, 'Wake Up Sid' and 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' were a result of this talented pair. Off-work, they are close buddies, often spotted holidaying together, I guess this rapport is what gets the natural flair and expertise out of the two. Our love for the two does not seem to fade at all, in fact, seems to get deeper with their next!Mr Bachchan, been there in the film industry for decades now, he has this modern director, R. Balki, who has provided him with films of out-of-the-box plots. Quintessentials are 'Cheeni Kum', 'Paa' and 'Shamitabh'. These have been path-breaking, and our hunger for this innovative genre of cinema has not been satiated yet! In fact, as full chances to give us the hunger pangs!We hope you enjoyed this compilation. If there are any more that you want us to include, you can surely list them in comments below.© 2015 DailyHunt ",15 Actor-Director Pairs From Bollywood Who Made It Big At The Box Office ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/wittyfeed+india-epaper-witty/15+actor+director+pairs+from+bollywood+who+made+it+big+at+the+box+office-newsid-69926349

""I was excited to see thousands of men and women coming together to participate in this walk for equality and supporting Oxfam's work. This year, a special focus is on our 'Bano Nayi Soch' campaign, which focuses on breaking gender stereotypes. In a country like India, where over 50 percent of women and men think that it is normal for women to be beaten by their spouses for a number of reasons, we at Oxfam are working to bring an end to this endemic problem of domestic violence. Surveys and Government reports reveal that women are abused for insignificant issues like not serving a hot meal on time or going out of the house without permission.

" 11 Bollywood Actresses With Surprising Educational Qualifications, Some Are College Dropouts While Some Are Gold Medallists Bollywood actresses are famous all around the world for their glamorous look, beauty and style statement. This is the reason they grab many eyeballs and take away millions of hearts. While some of the actresses stand at the epitome of beauty, some have excelled will in their academics. They are perfect to be titled as 'beauty with brains'. But there are also some actresses who dropped out of their school in order to pursue an acting career. Here we bring the educational qualifications of some of the Bollywood beauties.  Bollywood diva and former Miss World, Aishwarya Rai was a topper of her school. She passed her HSC exams with 90 percent and later applied for a degree in architecture. When she won Miss World contest, she chose not to study ahead as Bollywood was always her first priority.  Though Ameesha Patel couldn't get much success in Bollywood but her academics career is something to talk about. She studied at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai and was head girl for the academic year 1992-93 before heading overseas to study Bio-genetic engineering, which she studied for two years, and eventually switching to Economics at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. She graduated with a gold medal.  Kareena Kapoor is one such actress of Bollywood who is thought to be with little brains and more glamour. Kareena studied Commerce in Mumbai's Mithibai College for two years before she became famous and dropped out. She even went to Harvard for a short course.  One of the most successful actresses of Bollywood of her time, Kajol left her studies midway to make a Bollywood debut. At the age of sixteen, she began work on Rahul Rawail's film Bekhudi, which according to her was a ""big dose of luck"". She really gave up a lot to make a successful Bollywood career.  Soha has Masters degree in International Relations from the London School of Economics and Political Science by her side. Before stepping into Bollywood, she was an investment banker by profession.  The 'dimple' girl of Bollywood ranks high on education among all other Bollywood actresses. She did Bachelors in English with Honors from St. Bede's College in Shimla and then went on to do her Master's Degree in criminal psychology. Now that's we call 'beauty with brains'.  The fashionista of Bollywood, who never fails to impress us with her quirky choice of fashion, once confessed that her biggest regret in life is never completing her studies. She stopped studying after 12th standard and went on to become an actress.  Vidhya Balan has always played challenging roles and she undoubtedly nailed each one. When she was doing Hum Paanch, she was pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from St. Xavier's College. She also has a Master's Degree too from University of Mumbai.  Anushka Sharma is one of the most successful actresses of recent time who has played many challenging roles in her career. She has got degree in Arts from Mount Carmel College, Bangalore. She has also done Masters in Economics from correspondence.  Counted as one of the highest grossing actresses of Bollywood, Deepika left her studies midway to become an actress. Deepika had joined Mount Carmel in Bangalore, but never completed her studies there. She also enrolled for a short term course in IGNOU for further studies, but could never complete it.  Career of Parineeti Chopra is surely not flourishing but she has proved her acting talent in most of her films. Her transformation from fat to fit is enough to prove how determinant she is as a person. She also has very impressive educational qualifications. She has got the Triple Honors Degree in Business, Finance and Economics from Manchester Business School, England.          © 2015 DailyHunt ","11 Bollywood Actresses With Surprising Educational Qualifications, Some Are College Dropouts While Some Are Gold Medallists ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/stressbuster-epaper-strbusen/11+bollywood+actresses+with+surprising+educational+qualifications+some+are+college+dropouts+while+some+are+gold+medallists-newsid-68771444

"  Giving a respite to the owners of unapproved plot owners in the city, the Greater Chennai Corporation has started accepting applications to regularise unapproved individual plots. The plots would be regularised under the housing department's regularisation of unauthorised layouts and plots scheme. According to a press statement by the civic body, the regularisation applications for unapproved individual plots in sub-division or layouts should be submitted to the Works Department at Ripon Buildings with documents, plans and other details.Although the statement clarified that the applications would only be entertained after registering in the exclusive online portal.The housing department had announced the condoning scheme in October 2017, to regularise unapproved plots and layouts in the state to help the plummeting real estate industry and to obliterate apprehensions of plot owners in the state.  ""Plot owners can obtain regularisation of their individual plots lying in the layouts that received in-principle approvals from the CMDA,"" the Chennai Corporation official said. The civic body also said that the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has been approving in-principle layout framework. ""A total of 21 layout frameworks are approved and further 200 layout frameworks are under process and the in-principle approval for the layout frameworks will be issued soon,""the Chennai Corporation said.

There would be no levy of OSR charges for the plots registered prior to October 20, 2016, which is the cutoff date for the scheme. The last date for submission of application is May 3, 2018.   Property owners may be able to cut down the waiting time to get their documents as the registration department has ordered sub-registrars to stop inspecting buildings with proper planning permissions and issue documents without site inspections. In an official circular issued on Thursday, the Inspector-General of Registration J. Kumaragurubaran said that sub-registrars should derive the values of duties, according to dimensions mentioned in the approved plan.According to department sources, sub-registrars would thus far inspect the buildings to measure the dimensions and to fix duties accordingly. ""The new arrangement will cut the delay caused by the site inspection process and the owners will get their registered document sooner. However, the buildings without approved plans will be inspected by the sub-registrars,"" Kumaragurubaran said.The circular also directs sub-registrars to register the document without building inspection, if the property owners pay maximum stamp duty and registration fee for documents including settlements between family members.According to department sources, some sub-registrars have been inadvertently inspecting the buildings and causing the delay in handing over the registered documents. ""The new circular had been issued to clarify the concerned officials about the government orders,"" a source said. It is to be noted that the departmental government order had been issued in 2010 to give exemption from site inspections to the buildings whose value do not exceed Rs 1 lakh in rural areas and Rs 2 lakh in urban areas.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Chennai: Individual plot owners can apply for regularisation ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/chennai+individual+plot+owners+can+apply+for+regularisation-newsid-85186300

"ICC's meeting was attended by the chief executives of all the countries on December 7 and 8 where they discussed the Future Tour Programme (FTP) and the Indian cricket board's official also presented a revised FTP in which the BCCI tried to make a structure to ensure that all other member boards will keep their respective cricketers free from any bilateral commitments during the month of April and May, so that they can easily confirm their participation in the IPL.The England and Wales Cricket Board is the only board which still didn't commit to the two-month free window, but the Indian board is hopeful that soon the English board will accept the idea as their home summer starts only in the month of June. The new window will be started after the 2019 ICC World Cup and this point will be discussed at the BCCI's Special General Body (SGM) meeting in New Delhi on Monday.The introduction of the shortest format of the game had raised many questions over the future of the Test cricket and the 50-over format of the game. But now, people are in love with the shortest format of the game for the fact that it provides a full package of entertainment and through huge IPL revenues, India proved themselves as the biggest game-changer in the world of cricket.""IPL will be the only global marquee event from 2020,"" sources in the know of developments said as quoted by TOI.In the revised FTP which was presented by the Indian board, it seemed that BCCI tried to restructure India's home season as earlier Indian skipper Virat Kohli raised a question for the packed season this year. The BCCI will not go for any foreign tour between October and November, and February and March, in the next rights cycle from 2019 to 2023.Ahead of the IPL's 11th edition, India is scheduled to tour England and Australia in 2018. The BCCI has proposed that when the time comes to tour these countries in the next rights cycle, the tour will be divided into two parts consisting of Tests on one tour and limited-overs games on the next. England and Australia are already following this policy.In 2021, India will host the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC 50-over World Cup in 2023 and is expected to receive a huge profit as they demanded a hike in hosting fees.""The revised FTP suggests one simple formula. India will not play meaningless cricket anymore with any team.""Each member board is committed to six bilateral arrangements in two years. But the ICC cannot dictate the context in the content,"" say sources close to developments.An office-bearer, who had the revised FTP and will attend the SGM on Monday, seemed satisfied with the new FTP.""The FTP could be read along the lines of the same Big Three model that was first presented in 2014. Except that this isn't big three, it's big one,"" said a source.Ravi Rampaul or Shane Shillingford? Who will take more wickets?

"Talking about Forgotten stars like Mandakini,It has not been hidden from anyone that Bollywood has many aspects which are negative as well as positive.Looking towards the actors and actresses then it does happen in their case effectively. Bollywood has witnessed many performing talents but among them, only a few lucky and hardworking ones reach the stardom. There are many actors and actresses who deserve more limelight but situations were something different than that they want to be. Just as like Mandakini, Adhyayan Suman, Harman Baweja, Sikander Kher, Fardeen Khan, Kumar Gaurav, Ruslaan Mumtaz, Manahakshay Chakraborty, Amar Upadhyay, Zayed Khan, Rahul Roy, Barun Sobti, Ashmit Patel and many more were seen for less interval of time in Bollywood. Talking about the hot diva Mandakini, She is best remembered for her role in Ram Teri Ganga Maili in 1985. Most of the people are unaware that Mandakini was born in an Anglo Indian family in Meerut. Starting off as an unknown girl from Meerut, some filmmakers rejected her. Later on, she was cast in a lead role 1985 movie ""Ram Teri Ganga Maili"". The movie was a Blockbuster and it earned her a Filmfare nomination for the Best Actress. Her physical assets exploited to the full in the film which had caused a stir especially because of the two nude scenes in it .  Though she later worked with Mithun Chakraborty in the movie Dance Dance in 1987 it was not as comparative as her debut film . Mandakini quit acting in about 1996, after some of the directors, filmmakers and producers stopped offering her work . The main reason was her films were not done well and flopped in the past period. Also due to her relationship with Dawood the Gangster.  She is now settled in Mumbai with her daughter and husband and living happily with her family. © 2015 DailyHunt ",Bollywood's forgotten actress Mandakini. ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/live+smartly-epaper-livesmar/bollywood+s+forgotten+actress+mandakini-newsid-77571782
"  Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a fitting reply to Congress which has been targeting him for his silence over several issues.Addressing diaspora event 'Bharat Ki Baat, Sabke Saath' at the packed Central Hall at Westminster in downtown London, PM Modi said that he and his government are fine with the criticism and even welcomed it, but underlined that criticism was different from allegations levelled without any basis. The Prime Minister also explained why he remained silent in face of relentless criticism back home.PM Modi said his problem wasn't criticism which required a person to research and ascertain the facts to make a point but it was too much hard work and many people did not invest as much.Drawing a distinction between criticism and allegation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts. Sadly, it does not happen now. What happens instead is allegations. I want this Government to be criticized. Criticism makes democracy strong. Democracy cannot succeed without constructive criticism.""The Prime Minister called criticism a ""goldmine"" that helped him improve himself and correct his mistakes.But why doesn't he respond to the criticism, asked Prasoon Joshi, the adman-lyricist.Joshi, who was last year appointed to head the Chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification, was moderating the session which allowed selected individuals in India and abroad to ask questions.PM Modi acknowledged that there was a charge that he didn't speak up despite ""so much criticism"".This, he said, happened because he gave the criticism much importance, trying to understand where it was coming from and then rectify his mistakes.""But it is not my job to shut up people who are criticising me, my job is to think where am I going wrong,"" he said. It was his government's intentions, he said, which were beyond reproach.The explanation comes just a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's predecessor Dr Manmohan Singh advised him to speak more, an irony considering how Narendra Modi would mock the noted economist for his silence in public and derisively called him ""Maun' Mohan Singh"".Dr Manmohan Singh told The Indian Express on Tuesday that he had the same advice for PM Modi. ""I think the Prime Minister should follow his own advice to me and he should speak more often,"" he said.Other Congress leaders such as Rahul Gandhi have turned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on charges of corruption and nepotism that the opposition levels at him into campaign material for elections.Rahul Gandhi has on numerous occasions attacked the Prime Minister for his silence on celebrity designer Nirav Modi (wanted in fraud cases) slipping out of the country and the Rafale deal.When asked whether he can change the country alone, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was an ordinary citizen just like any other Indian. ""We have a million problems but we have a billion solutions,"" he said. ""I can make mistakes but I will not do any work with the ill intention,"" the Prime Minister said.PM Modi also spoke about crimes against women and asked parties not to politicise the heart-wrenching incidents.Attacking earlier governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said days of incremental change are over and Indians have become more and more aspirational under the BJP-led government at the Centre.PM Modi said people have more expectations from his government because they know that it can deliver. ""People know that when they say something, the Government will listen and do it. Days of incremental change are over,"" the Prime Minister said.During the 130-minute interaction, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Indian community on several issues ranging from surgical strikes to toilets to how he thinks his government's performance should be evaluated.

Protests have been held demanding justice for an eight-year-old girl raped and killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua and a 16-year-old who has accused a BJP lawmaker in Uttar Pradesh of raping her. In Surat, men and women held a silent candlelight march. The protests echoed the mass rallies against sexual violence in 2012 and mounted pressure on the government.© 2015 DailyHunt ","Girl's body, hand missing, fished out of drain in Haryana ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/kaumudiglobal-epaper-kglobal/girl+s+body+hand+missing+fished+out+of+drain+in+haryana-newsid-85829625
"Many of the world's top cricketers will be sold to the highest bidder when the Indian Premier League (IPL) holds its annual auction on Saturday and Sunday.Here are five players who can expect to hit it rich when the eight teams in the Twenty20 tournament place their bids in Bangalore:  Rising Pune Supergiant bought the troubled England all-rounder last year for a record $2.16 million. Stokes now faces a looming court case over a brawl in England, but IPL sides are still keen to sign the star who played a key role as Pune finished runners-up in 2017.The 26-year-old paceman and left-hand batsman is in the top bracket, with a base price of $312,500. ""He is an invaluable asset and a prize pick, there is no debate about that,"" Delhi Daredevils chief executive Hemant Dua told AFP.     Chris Gayle has played for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL). (PTI ) A top choice for any T20 team around the world, Chris Gayle is again expected to be at the centre of a bidding war among IPL franchises. The explosive West Indies opener was not retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore for the new season, giving other teams a chance to bag him. The left-hander, who has scored tons in almost every T20 league across the world, leads a West Indies contingent also featuring Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard. The self-proclaimed 'Universe Boss' was brought in as a replacement for Dirk Nannes in the 2011 edition and has since become one of the most powerful IPL performers.  The fastest bowler in Test cricket has already put his searing deliveries to good use in the IPL, even though the pitches normally favour slow bowlers and batsmen. Starc made his presence felt in 2014 and 2015 with Royal Challengers Bangalore, Starc missed 2016 through injury and then decided not to come to India last year. Starc will challenge Steve Smith and David Warner -- who were retained by their teams for $1.9 m each -- to become Australia's highest-paid IPL player.  Afghanistan's rise as a cricketing nation has been synonymous with the success of sensational leg-spinner Rashid Khan. The teenager became an overnight star in his war-ravaged country last year when was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for $625,000. Khan justified the price by taking 17 wickets in 14 matches at an impressive economy rate of 6.6 per over. Khan, who was named associate nation player of the year by the International Cricket Council, could be headed for another big pay day in a year when Afghanistan are slated to play their first-ever Test -- against India in Bangalore in June, just after the IPL finishes.  Crowded among India's big stars, under-19 national captain Prithvi Shaw could be the bargain pick of the auction. Put in the uncapped player category with a starting price of $3,125, the prolific batsman from Mumbai is being compared to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar. ""Prithvi Shaw has only just turned 18, but already has more cricket experience than many aspiring young players will have in their whole career,"" said a recent ICC tweet.© 2015 DailyHunt ","Mitchell Starc, Chris Gayle and new 'Sachin Tendulkar' - five players to watch out for in IPL auction ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/mitchell+starc+chris+gayle+and+new+sachin+tendulkar+five+players+to+watch+out+for+in+ipl+auction-newsid-80554926

"Nagpur Today : Nagpur NewsNagpur: The BJP’s city unit will be going in for a change of guard as the party high command has been contemplating on replacing the city party president Sudhakar Kohle to strenghten the organisation and bring it at par with the local units of Congress and Shiv Sena. Insiders revealed that the current Nagpur BJP President Kohle, also an MLA from South Nagpur will soon be replaced with former MLA and senior BJP leader Mohan Mate.BJP’s local circles are reportedly echoing its voice of dissent over the functioning of Kohle, which led the party to think over the rejig.Kohle is understood to have failed in bringing the organisation to the desired level and also lagging behind making populist moves to attract party workers. Believed as close to senior BJP leader and Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Kohle reportedly got in tiff with Guardian Minister in front of Chief Minister, over the issue to awarding the government contracts to the relatives. On the other hand, Mate has been into political exile ever since he completed his tenure as legislator. Following the series of allegations and counter attacks by the anti-Gadkari faction, Mate gradually lost popularity and eventually went on backfoot. However, meanwhile, Mate remained active in the social circles and cut across party lines to share the joys and sorrows among the leaders. Recently, all his supporters and various party leaders gave Mate a warm felicitation when he turned 50, which not only grabbed the attention of BJP high command but consolidated his position as the strong contender for the post as well.The decision to bring Mate into the mainstream of local BJP unit is believed to have taken as the preparation to the Lok Sabha and Assembly Elections next year. Mate may be given the post of Nagpur city BJP chief by April once both Gadkari and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis arrive at the unanimous decision. Sources revealed Kohle, on the other hand, will be considered for some senior position in the next state cabinet as he would be asked to step down from the current post. He has been reportedly asked by senior party cadres to remain active in Kalmeshwar-Saoner assembly constituency where the conflict of interest is likely to be witnessed between Kohle and serving MLA Sunil Kedar, both close to Gadkari.Mohan Mate to replace Kohle as Nagpur BJP Chief in April© 2015 DailyHunt ",Mohan Mate to replace Kohle as Nagpur BJP Chief in April ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/nagpur+today+english-epaper-nagpure/mohan+mate+to+replace+kohle+as+nagpur+bjp+chief+in+april-newsid-80825571

"Even as India witnesses persistent agricultural distress and farmer protests, there is a food revolution underway across the world. It is a true David (or more accurately, Davids) versus Goliath story, of what is called the peasant food web, taking on the industrial food chain. This revolution isn't happening in any one place, but all across the world. Like most revolutions, it is a fight that is being fuelled by grassroots energy and activism. And this is why it is bound to succeed. In the coming years, India - completely by accident - could be one of the key theatres for this victory.The terms industrial food chain and peasant food web were coined to contrast two competing food systems, in a report titled 'Who will feed us?' published in 2017 by the ETC Group, a research institution working on ecology, technology and economics. The report says the peasant food web is not a pseudonym for agro-ecology, organic farming, permaculture, or any other production system. Were organic farming employed throughout food production, we would be closer to food security but not necessarily closer to food sovereignty.The industrial food chain (IFC) refers to the various components of the links running from production inputs to consumption outcomes, and includes crop and livestock genomics, pesticides and fertilisers, as well as transportation and processing systems. The chain controls the policy environment of the world's most important resource - our food.The peasant food web (PFW) is made of small-scale producers, usually family or women-led, that include farmers, livestock-keepers and urban/peri-urban producers. While some peasants do use chemicals for commercial produce, most of what PWF produces is de facto organic.The statistics about the relative share of these two food systems in feeding the world are quite stunning: The PFW caters to more than 70% of the world's food needs, compared to 30% by the IFC, and yet only consumes 25% of the energy for this, compared to 75% of energy consumed by the IFC. And yet, advocates of the IFC have so far won most of the policy battles, defining government regulations in virtually every country. Our solutions for food systems are tilted towards IFC-based solutions: larger and more commercial farms, more mechanisation, more chemical fertiliser and pesticides, etc. This isn't because those who are advocating for industrial-scale solutions are evil, or morally compromised - rather, many are intensely public-spirited and have been seized by the gigantic challenge of feeding our populations. But change is coming from two independent streams: first, from the growing awareness of the long-term negative consequences of adopting IFC - such as monoculture (growing only one crop), or the impact of chemical fertilisers and pesticides on the inherent quality of the soil and final produce. Second, from a new force not evident a decade earlier - the steadily increasing sustainable food movement at the grassroots, aimed at providing a viable alternative to feed the world. The emerging change is being propelled not by unsubstantiated sentimentality, but by scientific evidence. The scientific community which earlier was an ally of the industrial chain system, is now more frequent in its support of the food web as a sustainable practice, with favourable research findings on how the food web approach results in better soil quality, less water usage, and superior food quality. What are the components of a successful 'food web' approach, and what is needed for the adoption of such an approach? Four key elements may be considered as critical components of this model: no use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides; diversity in seed banks; small landholdings by farmers and growers; and proximity to end consumer markets. A shift from using unhealthy chemicals as well as genetically modified seeds, requires determined champions to continue their policy advocacy to find the right solutions and political leadership. Establishing enabling food policies is critical to ensure that important experiments don't become innovation fireflies.The second two components are interlinked to regional land zoning plans, and demand side urban economics. For the model to work, there is a minimum catchment of demand, and a local geographic footprint to the supply. Urban centres are the logical theatres for such models to work. The success of the model depends upon a critical mass of urban consumers who are demanding better quality food, and who will not only sustain the economics of this approach, but also act as a tipping point for more consumer conversion. Combined with adequate demand, minimising the farm to table distance is critical to ensure the economics of the approach.With adequate incentives, farmers will switch their growing practices, and be able to quickly see the economic gain from doing so. Such a localised food system allows all four components to work together. When there is adequate policy support, this local, 'small is beautiful' food web approach may be able to build a quiet foundation, which grows organically over time to take an increasing share of the food wallet of the urban consumer.      © 2015 DailyHunt ",India should adopt the peasant food web as a sustainable practice ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/india+should+adopt+the+peasant+food+web+as+a+sustainable+practice-newsid-86046031

"India is sliding toward a collapse of humanity and ethics in political and civic life, as the recent reports of the rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl from a seminomadic Muslim community in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir reveal. Politicians from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party defended the men accused of the crime and ignited a furious debate about the fundamental character of the country.The child was abducted in January and imprisoned for a week in a temple, where she was drugged, starved and raped repeatedly before being murdered.Her body was thrown into the forest. At the time the crime passed without much comment beyond the local press. Outrage finally exploded last week, after a front-page report in the Indian Express newspaper revealed terrifying details from the police charge sheet, including the fact that one of the accused, a police officer, had asked his co-conspirators to hold off killing the child so that he could rape her once more.The charge sheet and other reports strongly suggested that this was not a random crime but one deliberately in line with the ugly sectarian politics playing out across India. Intimidation of religious minorities and violence against them has increased since Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the Bharatiya Janata Party to power in 2014. India's traditional secularism is now locked in battle with the new majoritarian, Hindu chauvinist politics he represents.The 8-year-old girl belonged to the Muslim Bakarwal people, who move with their sheep and horses between high mountain pastures in the summer and the plains of the Hindu-dominated Jammu region in winter. There is tension with local Hindus over the right to graze animals on the land. According to the police, the motive of the premeditated crime was to terrorize the Bakarwals and dislodge them from the area. The bereaved parents were not even allowed to bury the child in the village. They have since fled the area.A newly formed group called Hindu Ekta Manch, or ""Hindu Unity Forum,"" organized a protest march in defense of the accused, who include a retired government official and two police officers. Thousands joined in, many waving the Indian national flag. Vijay Sharma, a co-founder of the group and an organizer of the march, was also a high-ranking leader of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in the region.Modi's party shares power with a regional political party in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Two BJP ministers in the state government joined the protest in defense of the accused. ""So what if a girl died?"" one of them remarked. ""Many girls die every day.""They demanded that the investigation be transferred from the state police - the investigators included Muslim officers - to the federal Central Bureau of Investigation, a largely delegitimized institution that serves as a de facto arm of the ruling party. Lawyers at a court in the city of Jammu tried to physically prevent officials from filing charges against the accused and have threatened the lawyer who is representing the girl's family.Over the past week, horrified Indians have protested vigorously on social media and in some cities. The disgust and the fury at the complicity of politicians, and the federal government's silence grew into a thunderous chorus demanding that the prime minister speak up and fire the ministers backing the Hindu Ekta Manch.Belatedly reacting to popular outrage, Modi finally said: ""Incidents being discussed since past two days cannot be part of a civilized society. As a country, as a society, we all are ashamed of it."" He promised justice. His vague statement delicately alluded to another case in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where a lawmaker from Modi's party is accused of rape. Modi stayed away from his party's involvement in both cases.Yet instead of uniting India in horror, the incident has deepened religious, political and ethical divides. It has also made clear that there is no automatic political cost to crime or falsehood if it furthers the hegemonic political narrative. The politicians involved were sacked only after a huge public outcry. Government ministers, officials, right-leaning media and right-wing supporters have been perfectly sanguine about using the dead child to polarize society with whataboutery, fake news and wild conspiracy theories.A spokeswoman for Modi's party, Meenakshi Lekhi, attacked opposition protests, suggesting that they were selective and opportunistic. ""You see their plan,"" she said. ""First shout 'minority minority', then 'Dalit Dalit' and now 'women women' and then try to somehow fix blame of state issues on the centre."" An influential ex-editor tweeted that Muslim Rohingya refugees were to blame for the crime. A BJP youth activist posted a comment, now deleted, on his Facebook page saying that the rape must have been fun. A pornography site reported a surge in searches for videos using the raped and murdered girl's name.The sense of national crisis today is because Indians feel a rising urgency to either counter this ethical collapse or to capitalise on it in the run-up to the next election. Modi came to power in 2014, and four years into his term, religious and cultural bigotry stands mainstreamed in Indian society.Many who voted for Modi's economic promises are disappointed by his failure to deliver, and impatient with his deliberate silences around sectarian and sexual violence and hate speech by his party colleagues and ministers. The systematic destruction of democratic institutions is hard to ignore.The BJP and its Hindu nationalist affiliates are bent on refashioning India into a country that is increasingly hostile to secular, democratic, pluralist and minority Indians. The rape and murder of the little nomad girl has thus taken on a larger meaning, reflecting the struggle for the fundamental character of India.An open letter to the prime minister signed by retired civil servants strongly protested ""the agenda of division and hate your party . insidiously introduced into the grammar of our politics, our social and cultural life and even our daily discourse"" and held him directly responsible for ""this terrifying state of affairs.""This battle for the soul and future of India is likely to get more violent in the lead-up to the national elections, scheduled for next year. Modi's BJP is braced for a desperate, ugly fight and has a long history of using religious polarization to electoral advantage.It will be up to the citizens of India to fight for a tolerant, pluralist country and stop the degeneration of its civic and political life.   ----  International New York Times © 2015 DailyHunt ",What rape and murder of a child says about Modi's India ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/what+rape+and+murder+of+a+child+says+about+modi+s+india-newsid-86011338

"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday took a dig at Congress president Rahul Gandhi following the Supreme Court verdict which rejected a demand for an independent probe into the alleged mysterious death of CBI Judge Brijmohan Harikishan Loya.In two tweets written in Hindi from his official Twitter handle, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader claimed that the verdict exposes the ugly face of the Congress and alleged that Gandhi attempts to defame anyone who wants to run the country smoothly.""The plea in Justice Loya death case has been rejected. It clearly exposes the ugly face of the Congress party.The complaint by Rahul Gandhi and 150 other MPs came out to be a sack of lies,"" wrote Adityanath. जस्टिस लोया के मामले में वाद खारिज हो गया है। स्पष्ट है कि कांग्रेस का घृणित चेहरा सामने आया है। श्री राहुल गांधी ने 150 सांसदों को लेकर शिकायत की थी, जबकि सबकुछ झूठ का पुलिन्दा निकला। ""Rahul Gandhi doesn't want anyone other than the Gandhi family to run the nation. And he relentlessly tries to destroy the image of anyone who runs the nation properly,"" alleged Adityanath in a second tweet.श्री राहुल गांधी नहीं चाहते कि गांधी परिवार के अलावा इस देश में कोई शासन चलाए और जो शासन अच्छे प्रकार से चलाता है उसकी छवि को निरन्तर बदनाम करने का प्रयास करते है। In a press conference held in New Delhi today, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed that the nation has lost faith in Rahul Gandhi.""I would like to tell you, Rahul Gandhi, that you have lost the faith of the people of this country. You lost power because of your inaction and this is why you are burning with the desire for revenge,"" Patra said.Earlier today, a three-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud pronounced its verdict following an extensive hearing in the demand for an independent probe which began on 2 February.The court said that there is no reason to doubt the statement of four judges who were with Judge Loya on the last day of his life because that would tantamount to doubting the integrity of the judiciary. The four judges - J Kulkarni, J Barde, J Modak and JRR Rathi - had termed his death as ""natural"".The apex court had on 16 March reserved its verdict on a batch of five petitions seeking an independent probe.The bench had during one of the hearings stated that it will not hesitate to order an investigation ""if our conscience is aroused to order inquiry"" in public interest.Official records state that Judge Loya died of a heart attack on 1 December 2014 when he had gone to attend the wedding of a colleague's daughter.Tehseen Poonawalla, one of the petitioners, told reporters that the verdict was ""very disappointing"".© 2015 DailyHunt ",Judge Loya death case verdict exposes ugly face of Congress: Yogi Adityanath ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+statesman-epaper-statesman/judge+loya+death+case+verdict+exposes+ugly+face+of+congress+yogi+adityanath-newsid-86047388?tk=

" On Basava Jayanthi on Wednesday, former minister and mining baron Gali Janardhan Reddy said that BJP state president B.S. Yeddyurappa will become Chief Minister again after the state assembly polls. Mr Reddy had played a pivotal role in ensuring the party's victory in 2008 but later, the party distanced itself from him after the mining baron got embroiled in a series of illegal mining cases and was arrested.After meeting the Siddaganga Math seer here, Mr Reddy told reporters that he visited the math to seek the blessings of Sri Shiva kumara Swamiji.He asserted that that Lingayat strongman B.S. Yeddyurappa will become Chief Minister after the assembly elections.  ""The BJP is in my blood, I will work to see Yeddyurappa become CM after this elections"", he said. It may be recalled that Mr Reddy along with 40-odd BJP MLAs had rebelled against Mr Yeddyurappa in 2009 in an attempt to dethrone him from the CM post . However, both entered into a truce after the intervention of party senior leader Ms Sushma Swaraj.The former minister also said that despite the rebellion by sitting BJP MLA in Molakalmuru, Thippeswamy, his close friend and Ballari MP B. Sriramulu, the BJP candidate for the constituency, will emerge victorious. He, however, refused to comment on the statement of Party National President Mr Amit Shah that the BJP has nothing to do with Mr Reddy.  While some in the BJP believe state party chief, B.S. Yeddyurappa, is playing a big role in selection of candidates for the party's final list for the coming assembly poll, others claim that winna bility is the only criterion being followed and this is why the party has been slow in releasing it. ""The final list is the one that takes much longer to finalise as the party is scouting for candidates who can win and help it get a simple majority of 113 seats,"" said a senior leader.The BJP ,which has so far not announ ced candidates for many south Karna taka and Bengaluru city constituencies, has, surprisingly, not announced candidates for a few seats in coastal Karnata- ka as well although it is considered its stronghold. While some claim that old loyalists are being ignored and tickets are being given to those who deserted the party along with Mr Yeddyurappa and returned with him, others dismiss the theory.""It is not a question of loyalists or non-loyalists getting tickets. We have to win and so the party is trying to field the right candidates. In Tumakuru, loyalist S. Shivanna came fourth in the last assembly elections and so Jyothi Prasad, who was a KJP candidate, but performed well, got the party ticket,"" said a party insider, explaining that so far Mr Yeddyurappa has been given the freedom to choose candidates for nearly 30 per cent of the seats announced considering his experience, tour of the state and feedback from district workers. Another 30 per cent of candidates were backed by top senior leaders like Ananth Kumar and D.V. Sadanada Gowda. And around 15 to 20 per cent by different frontal organisations. ""All these were accommodated in the first and the second lists. Now in the last leg, we need to field candidates, who can help us get a clear lead over our rivals,"" said the leader.© 2015 DailyHunt ","You can keep me out of BJP, but not BJP out of me: Gali Janardhan Reddy ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/you+can+keep+me+out+of+bjp+but+not+bjp+out+of+me+gali+janardhan+reddy-newsid-86025958
" : In 2004, she made headlines when she accompanied her father and Chief Minister S.M. Krishna during his campaign tour of Chamarajpet Assembly constituency, but almost a decade-and-half later Shambhavi could be back, set to endure the dust and grime of electoral politics. For, in a significant development, BJP leaders are likely to pick her as the candidate for either Yeshwanthpur or Chamarajpet constituencies. The likelihood of Mrs Shambhavi Hingorani making her debut in electoral politics emerged at the end of a meeting between Union minister H.N. Ananth Kumar, BJP Karnataka in charge P.Muralidhar Rao and Mr Krishna at the latter's residence on Friday. Sources in the state unit of BJP said the strategy behind Shambhavi's candidature would be to help the party gain from division of votes of minorities with the ruling Congress and JD (S) set to field Zameer Ahmed Khan and Altaf Khan respectively in Chamarajpet. In Yeshwanthpur, a constituency with significant number of Vokkaliga voters, the BJP aims to wrest the seat earlier held by Ms Shobha Karandlaje before she was elected to Lok Sabha. In 2013, Mr S T Somashekhar, also a Vokkaliga, won on a Congress ticket.  Sources said Mr Krishna's USP as the man who transformed the city into the IT capital is something the BJP will use to woo the aspirational young voter.The former foreign minister has agreed to campaign in Bengaluru besides evincing interest in fielding good candidates in Mandya and Mysuru districts. The octogenarian has already held meetings with powerful Vokkaliga leaders in Mandya district, sources added.© 2015 DailyHunt ",SM Krishna's daughter may get Yeshwanthpur or Chickpet ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/sm+krishna+s+daughter+may+get+yeshwanthpur+or+chickpet-newsid-85743918

"Corals on Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef experienced a catastrophic die-off following the extended marine heatwave of 2016, a study has found.Scientists from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (Coral CoE) in Australia mapped the geographical pattern of heat exposure from satellites.   They measured coral survival along the 2,300 kilometre length of the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef system, following the extreme marine heatwave of 2016.The study published in the journal Nature found that 29 per cent of the 3,863 reefs comprising the world's largest reef system lost two-thirds or more of their corals, transforming the ability of these reefs to sustain full ecological functioning.""When corals bleach from a heatwave, they can either survive and regain their colour slowly as the temperature drops, or they can die,"" said Terry Hughes from ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (Coral CoE).""Averaged across the whole Great Barrier Reef, we lost 30 per cent of the corals in the nine month period between March and November 2016,"" said Hughes.The amount of coral death the researchers measured was closely linked to the amount of bleaching and level of heat exposure, with the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef being the most severely affected.""The coral die-off has caused radical changes in the mix of coral species on hundreds of individual reefs, where mature and diverse reef communities are being transformed into more degraded systems, with just a few tough species remaining,"" said Andrew Baird of Coral CoE at James Cook University.""As part of a global heat and coral bleaching event spanning 2014-2017, the Great Barrier Reef experienced severe heat stress and bleaching again in 2017, this time affecting the central region of the Great Barrier Reef,"" said Mark Eakin of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.""We are now at a point where we have lost close to half of the corals in shallow-water habitats across the northern two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef due to back-to-back bleaching over two consecutive years,"" said Sean Connolly of Coral CoE at James Cook University.""But, that still leaves a billion or so corals alive, and on average, they are tougher than the ones that died. We need to focus urgently on protecting the glass that is still half full, by helping these survivors to recover,"" said Hughes.These findings reinforce the need for assessing the risk of a wide-scale collapse of reef ecosystems, especially if global action on climate change fails to limit warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.The study is unique because it tests the emerging framework for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems, which seeks to classify vulnerable ecosystems as 'safe,' 'threatened' or 'endangered.' ""The Great Barrier Reef is certainly threatened by climate change, but it is not doomed if we deal very quickly with greenhouse gas emissions. Our study shows that coral reefs are already shifting radically in response to unprecedented heatwaves,"" said Hughes.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Study reveals global warming is killing the Great Barrier Reef ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/study+reveals+global+warming+is+killing+the+great+barrier+reef-newsid-86059788

"Often called the God of Cricket, Sachin Tendulkar is pretty much everyone's favourite. What happens when the God of Cricket himself joins you for a game? Yes, it happened to a few lucky youngsters in Mumbai! For these restaurant workers, a routine night of playing some cricket to unwind after work became one to remember forever when the humble Master Blaster joined them.    A screengrab from the video of Sachin playing with the youngsters The video of the quick game, which went viral almost instantly, shows Sachin getting out of his car and shaking hands with the boys, before taking his stance in front of a plastic road divider.As he looked like he rolled the years back, Sachin played a few shots before taking selfies with them. Sameer Shaikh, the manager of the food delivery joint where the youngsters all under the age of 25 work, says, ""We were wondering who this person was who parked his car in the middle of the road in such a narrow lane,"" he chuckles, now recounting the incident. ""He was possibly clicking a selfie or making a video while in the car.""   The youngsters all under the age of 25 work at a food joint And as the car came closer, it was a rather filmy moment for the gang, who regularly play cricket to unwind after their 12-hour shifts. Salman Ahmed Syed says, ""One of Sachin's friends came out from the car and told us 'There is a man who played in the Indian cricket team and now wants to play with you. Will you allow him to?' We said okay, and asked the man to call the cricketer out. We had no idea it was Sachin!""  After a quick few selfies, the cricketer departed but not without setting social media on fire with his warmth and humbleness Another employee, Ramanuj Dhuriya adds, ""Sachin was apparently going to meet his friend, but stopped when he saw us and said he'd rather play with us first!""He may have barely played four balls but the ace batsman gave the awestruck boys something to remember him by. ""He spoke to us in Marathi and asked us 'ball kon pakadnar' (who will catch the ball?) He did not miss a single ball!"" Sameer says with a shy smile. ""He asked us what we do and we told him about our food joint.""However, their moment of quick cricket was interrupted when cars stopping by realised it was indeed Sachin on the streets playing cricket, and ran towards him for pictures. A woman in the car came to a quick halt and jumped out on spotting him, screaming, ""Sachin, I love you."" That gathered the attention of other folks as well, causing Sachin to quickly take pictures with his 'team mates', before he zoomed off.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Master Blaster's gully cricket adventure ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/bangladesh/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/master+blaster+s+gully+cricket+adventure-newsid-85939712

"You may feel that the guy you are in love with is your soulmate but does he feel the same about you? You are head over heels in love with him but does he love you with the same intensity? There is always a thin line between love and lust and it's easy to confuse the two, especially in the early stages of relationship.  Love and lust both make you feel a kind of bliss that you have never experienced before. These are the emotions which are wonderful and joyous and something to celebrate.But there is difference between the man who searches for lust and the one who wants love. Need little help? Here are few signs!   The man who is in love with you would do every possible thing to sweep you off your feet when on a date. He treats you like princess because he wants to give the world to you that you deserve.  But the man who search for pure lust, won't be that elaborate with you dates and would set up things which end up in bed.  This is one of those clear signs which show that the man you are in love with completely searches for lust or love in you. The one who loves you will be very clear about his intentions and the purpose of the marriage.  The man who lusts will never give you a straight answer when you ask him about marriage and will always keep you questioning.  The man who is truly in love with you says ""I love you"" because he genuinely feels love and wants you to know it. He will whisper those three magical words in your ear when he is in making love to you.  But the man who lusts you says, ""I love you"" when he is sorry or when he wants to take you into the bed.  Love is something that connects people from heart to hear. Your love can make a person feel better even when you are not physically available to her.  The kind of man who loves you would always be emotionally available to you but the man who lusts for you will not care for your emotional state no matter is physically with you or not.  The man who searches for love in you would be genuinely interested in knowing about the people who are an important part of your life like your family and friends. He may be interested in knowing them better and would want to meet them.  But the man, who only lusts for you, is generally not interested in knowing about your closed ones.  When you two get into fight, the man who lusts, will threaten to leave you. But the man, who is genuinely in love with you, will stick around and clean up the mess no matter who created it in the first place.  He understands that conflicts are part of a relationship and want happy memories and commitment with you.  The man who wants love, will love you even when you in your payjama and oversized t-shirt. He will find you cute in your messy hair and your clothes don't affect him much. But the man, who lusts, will always expect you to dress up and look perfect for him.  He will always demand you to wear revealing clothes in front of his friends so that he can make them for having a hot girlfriend.  The man who lusts will view your body as one of the most important part of the relationship and will always comment on your for your weight. But the man who loves you understands that bodies fluctuate in size and will never be perfect.  He wants you to be confident in your own skin and has no issues with you weight. But he wants you to be fit so that you can lead a healthy life.  Everyone has their opinion and they like to share it with their loved ones. But the man who lusts never leaves a room for your opinion.  Plus, your desires don't matter to him. But the man, who loves will always ask what you would like and tries his best to find a resolution that makes you both happy.  When it comes to cooking, cleaning or having a life plan, the man, who lusts will not care at all. He will take no interest in daily chores and will not care about helping you out.  But the man who loves will do laundry, prepare a nice dish and even paint your toes nails. He will also have a savings account to plan for your future and essentially have his life in order. Now that you know the difference, be with the man who truly loves you! © 2015 DailyHunt ",10 Signs He Is In Lust And Not In Love With You! ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/stressbuster-epaper-strbusen/10+signs+he+is+in+lust+and+not+in+love+with+you-newsid-65765250

"The Income Tax Department on Wednesday cautioned salaried class taxpayers against using illegal means like under-reporting of income or ""inflating"" deductions while filing their returns, stating violators will be prosecuted and their employers will be intimated to take action against them.The Central Processing Centre (CPC) of the department in Bengaluru, that receives and processes the Income Tax Returns (ITRs), has issued an advisory specifying such taxpayers should not ""fall prey"" to unscrupulous tax advisors or planners who help them in preparing wrong claims to get tax benefits.Calling it a ""cautionary advisory"" on reports of tax evasion by under-reporting of income or inflating deductions or exemptions by salaried taxpayers, the department said such attempts ""aided and abetted by unscrupulous intermediaries have been noted with concern"".""Such offences are punishable under various penal and prosecution provisions of the Income Tax Act,"" it said.The advisory comes in the backdrop of the investigation wing of the department, in January, unearthing a racket of extracting fraudulent tax refunds by employees of bellwether information technology companies based in Bengaluru, in alleged connivance with a tax advisor.The CBI recently registered a criminal case to probe this nexus.The tax filing season for salaried class taxpayers has just begun with the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), that frames the policy for the department, recently notifying the new ITRs.The one-page advisory added that if the department notices any fraudulent claims in their ITRs, such claims ""may be punishable under provisions of the IT Act and this may also delay issuance of their refunds.""""Taxpayers, are, therefore strictly advised not to fall prey to false promises or misadvice by unscrupulous intermediaries and submit wrong claims in their ITRs, which would be treated as cases of tax evasion. In the cases of such wrong claims by the government/PSU employees, the reference would be made to the concerned vigilance division for action under conduct rules,"" it added.The advisory added that the department possesses an ""extensive risk analysis system"" that is aimed at identifying persons who are non-compliant and aim to subvert the trust based-system ""envisioned"" while processing of ITRs at the CPC, which it said is automated and devoid of any human interface.""In all such cases of high risk, the department may examine and verify the details submitted by taxpayers in their ITR subsequent to the processing of returns,"" it said.It also asked tax planners and advisors to ""confine their advice to taxpayers within the four corners of the IT Act"" and warned that the violators will be prosecuted and such instances will also be referred to enforcement agencies like the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for criminal prosecution. © 2015 DailyHunt ",IT warns salaried class against filing wrong ITRs ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+herald-epaper-deccan/i+t+warns+salaried+class+against+filing+wrong+itrs-newsid-86016887?s=a&ss=pd

"  A minor Hindu girl from Kolkata is in captive since last June due to the idleness of Kolkata Police. Though the police know the location of the girl, out of fear of entering in ""sensitive"" area the force has not even raided the location. The helpless father of the girl has been compelled to move to Calcutta High Court after which the court has expressed high concern and ordered for immediate action. As per Sangbad Pratidin report, Vinod Das is a staff of Kolkata Municipal Corporation.Korban Ali and his son Mintu Sheikh abducted Vinod Das's her minor daughter on 9th June 2017. He has complained that West Bengal police has refused to raid the place to recover the girl citing law & order concerns in a 'sensitive' area. After the death of his wife, Vinod Das's minor daughter used to stay in Gardenrich's Meher Manzil area at a close relative's place. The girl was supposed to sit for the Madhyamik examination. Suddenly from 9th June, she goes missing. When Vinod das came to know that Mintu kidnapped his daughter, along with his neighbors he instantly went to local police station. But eight months have passed by, police has done nothing.Due to idleness of police, Vinod sought help from judiciary. His advocate Uday Jha has alleged that exact location and phone number of the alleged criminal have been handed over to Police. Judge Debangshu Basak issued a stinging order asking Kolkata's Joint Commissioner of Police to take immediate action. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 28th Feb.Khidirpur- Garden reach- Metiabruz area seems to be a complete isolated island in Kolkata.

"Technology and Education go hand-in-hand these days and educational technology can not be seen as a separate entity or two different terminologies, rather an inseparable combination believes Mr. Ajay Sakhamuri, the young entrepreneur, who has been formulating ways to transform education through technology. The manifestation of technology in the present era is apparent says, Ajay, recollecting the old days of how and when the seed was planted in his heart to build a technological product for schools.It was in 2007 when Ajay who was in his final year of graduation undertook a project on ""Campus Express - An online onboarding site for all students at Penn,"" was the thought conceived to build a software for schools.Motivated by his father to work on the project, who himself was a business professional, influenced Ajay to dig deep into the technology. However, the project could not sustain due to lack of revenue clarity. Meanwhile, Ajay got recruited for Deloitte Company as a part of campus placements before he could finish his B.Tech. He joined Deloitte as an SAP ABAP consultant and worked there for almost 2 years. With the seed still alive in him to build a school product, Ajay during his tenure in Deloitte, correlated the SAP technology to the educational stream. When SAP can help large businesses in growing by giving a global exposure, why not schools be enlightened with the same formula? This strong conception further persuaded the young entrepreneur to perform a market analysis on schools that are using technology. The outcome was that not many schools were into technology, and if any, they were using only excel sheets.The aftermath revealed that when using technology in schools there was a huge scope for technology infused products in the educational sector. Initially, there was Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model for schools to curb the need, despite which, schools were using offline methods. Ajay was strongly convinced that there was a dire need to solve the problem in the educational space and there was no key player to work on the same lines and develop a product that illuminates the schools. This triggered the determination in Ajay and he felt it was a good opportunity to think of the same in the vertical and bring out a solution becoming the first in the market to develop a school software.""It's not about what you build, it's about what people need,"" says the entrepreneur while speaking about the impact of technology in an Educational realm and the obligation for a school software. Continuing further, he says, the reminiscing history of Indian Education system has seen a gigantic transformation over the past decades. Starting with the ancient Educational system comprising the Gurukula system of education to the modern education system, the education system in India had witnessed a revolution.Stressing on the technological transformation in the educational sector, Ajay says, ""India has become the second largest market for e-learning after the US. This depicts the changing face of education in India with technology becoming the most important ingredient in the field of education.""The enthusiastic entrepreneur set out on a mission to build a product for schools that would pull them out from the intricacies involved in the school chores and also contribute to the technological development and educational metamorphism. The initial 2-3 years was focused on product development. After a series of strenuous efforts and unceasing groundwork from the Resource and Development team for two valuable years, the MyClassboard school management software product was carved out. During the construction phase, the team managed to build a strong product by cracking large school chains.Good marketing efforts and working with reputed school chains formed the basis to develop MyClassboard by giving it a frame. In 2009, MyClassboard stepped out of the ring to exhibit its product by offering a free pilot project in those selected large chains of schools. The bold step finally did pay off receiving valuable feedback from the associates following which the R&D team scrutinized the series of feedback collected, worked on them and further implemented the necessary changes and developed the product into a complete software. Only after that, Ajay shifted his focus to scaling product and schools.MyClassboard was now a finished product that attracted the eye of many. It did captivate the pilot clients to try the engineered software and become serious clients to MyClassboard. ""This was the first and major step to our success path where our clients elated by our product services referred us to their peers,"" says Ajay. ""Our pilot team then took our product to all those referred schools and no sooner they too became our clients by embracing our product.""In a very short span of time, MyClassboard could make 100 clients only through a reference from its existing clients. The journey of MyClassboard towards a successful beginning started then by exposing the product to all schools across the nation starting with Hyderabad, Bangalore, North India, and North-East.It has been 8 years since MyClassboard began its steps towards the field of education and now here it stands with head held high in a business relationship with more than 1200 schools, benefiting over 9 lakh students through its value added services. Enabling its services to all schools, MyClassboard walked an extra mile by making its modules available as per the requirements of schools. The module-wise sales have put MyClassboard in the limelight.When many start-up companies or organizations struggle to make their survival during the initial phases, MyClassboard not only survived the competition but also made its existence known by setting up a province for itself in the market and becoming India's most widely used software. For all those willing to have a foretaste of the software, MyClassboard entertains them as well with a free trial service encouraging prospective clients to discern its unique services from others in the market.Making technology as the hub, MyClassboard has been constantly upgrading its software in tune with the emerging technologies to meet the global standards. Every year, MyClassboard has come up with a new version of the product making it user-friendly and perfectly feasible. Slowly yet consistently, MyClassboard could make a stand in the market simultaneously expanding its territory to Middle-Eastern countries as well.MyClassboard offers modules that every institution needs like Admissions module, Gradebook, Parent Teacher communicator, Attendance Tracker, Reporting Tool, Transport management application, Fee management application and many other feature rich modules.Apart from efficiently managing the school operations of all departments, MyClassboard goes much beyond than just being a school management software. It offers a suite of solutions that helps the school administrators in running the school efficiently and hassle-free.Ajay's MyClassboard has made a phenomenal progress since its birth in the field of education and has been equipping schools to reach their desired haven.© 2015 DailyHunt ","'It's not About What You Build, It's About What People Need' Says Ajay Sakhamuri, MyClassboard ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/business+world-epaper-bizworld/it+s+not+about+what+you+build+it+s+about+what+people+need+says+ajay+sakhamuri+myclassboard-newsid-68845112

But lately things aren't bright for the comedian, as a matter of fact they look really dark. Something has happened to him, he's not feeling healthy which is one of the reasons why 'The Kapil Sharma' went off air. And even now when he's back with 'Family Time With Kapil Sharma', he's again cancelling the shoots of new episodes. So all is definitely not well in the professional and personal life of Kapil.

There's nothing wrong with being ambitious, everyone has the freedom to chase their passion, try out different things or experiment. His fans will always support him in his different business and career ventures. But he should never forget that his fans didn't fell in love with Kapil 'The Singer' or Kapil 'The Actor', they became his fans for his brilliant stand-up comedy talent. So he should focus all his efforts on comedy which made the people fell in love with him in the first place.  2. Never ever forget your roots. If you want people to respect you and admire you then you must also treat others with respect. Your pride and ego can cost you everything that you worked hard your entire life for.

He even abused and allegedly threw a shoe at Sunil Grover who tried to calm him down.  3. Kapil Sharma needs to innovate not imitate. His act and jokes are not working anymore, audience needs something refreshing now. His way of making people laugh by insulting others and degrading other characters is getting old. Kapil's jokes are misogynistic, inhumane, and disrespectful at times.   4. It was reported that Kapil was in a drunken state when he assaulted Sunil Grover. Even Kapil has admitted using alcohol as a means to cope up with all the negativity around him. The comedian needs to defeat his inner demons and get back on the track. There's no shame in seeking medical help.  5. Kapil's downfall came shortly after he separated from his longtime manager and girlfriend Preeti Simoes. His ex girlfriend Preeti has expressed the desire to reconcile things and get back together, but she believes Kapil's ego won't allow that. She even believes that Kapil is suicidal and that his girlfriend Ginni Chatrath is responsible for the comedian's demise.  © 2015 DailyHunt ",5 Reasons Behind The Downfall Of Kapil Sharma ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/rvcj-epaper-rvcj/5+reasons+behind+the+downfall+of+kapil+sharma-newsid-85887582

"Reports of a cash crunch in certain parts of the country have brought back some of the questions that were asked in the aftermath of demonetisation. In November 2016, when the Narendra Modi led government withdrew 86 percent of the country's currency, the hope was that the use of cash in the economy would reduce. Not only would the stock of cash, some of it accounted for, find its way into bank deposits, but the use of cash in regular transactions would also fall as customers migrated towards electronic payments.Currency in circulation stood at Rs 18.4 lakh crore as on 6 April 2018. In absolute terms, this is above the Rs 17.98 lakh crore in currency that existed before demonetisation. As a percentage of GDP, cash is currently at 10.8 percent of FY18 nominal GDP compared to 12 percent before demonetisation. The gap is assumed to be a change in consumer preference for cash.The Economic Survey released on 28 January, said that the cash-to-GDP ratio had stabilised at lower levels. In absolute terms, cash was lower by Rs 2.8 lakh crore or 1.8 percent of GDP, estimated the Economic Survey. However, over the last few months, the pace at which currency in circulation is growing has picked up.""Analysts, for a while, had spotted a sharp rise in cash, particularly in December-January '18, a puzzling phenomenon, largely unexplained beyond the standard suspects - elections, kharif crop marketing, etc... This trend seems to have persisted in the first 2 weeks of FY19,"" wrote Saugato Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank in a note on Friday.Is the increased demand temporary? Or does this suggest that the preference for cash, for some reason, is moving closer to pre-demonetisation levels?R Gandhi, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, told BloombergQuint that based on pre-demonetisation trends, currency in circulation should have been at close to Rs 23 lakh crore compared to the Rs 18 lakh crore right now.""That Rs 5 lakh crore difference is because of people having shifted from cash to bank deposits. If we assume that people have moved back to cash (that is an assumption), then there would be a shortage. But estimating that is not easy,"" Gandhi said.Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse also pointed out that the Rs 45,000 crore rise in currency in circulation is the lowest since 2013. As a percentage of GDP, it is lowest in nearly 10 years. Could this suggest that growth in currency is not keeping pace with the typical pick-up in demand, leading to a shortage?Cash withdrawals at ATMs is another indicator being tracked to see whether cash habits changed after demonetisation. It may also hold clues to the recent cash crunch.Data on the value of monthly transactions at ATMs suggests that demand for cash at ATMs rebounded quickly as cash availability improved in the months after demonetisation. By October 2017, the value of ATM withdrawals had hit pre-demonetisation levels.Since then, economists point out that there have been two noteworthy trends.Soumyakanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India, points out ATM withdrawals in the second half of the fiscal saw a larger jump than normal.Could this be simply because of a pick-up in economic activity in the second half of the year? Perhaps.Bhattacharya of Axis Bank highlights another trend. There has been a drop in transaction volumes in FY18 but not in the value of transactions, implying a steep rise in the average size of transactions.While ATM withdrawals have remained strong, in recent months, the RBI has been supplying more lower denomination notes, said a senior banker speaking on condition of anonymity. This has meant that banks need to replenish ATMs more frequently, which has been a challenge, this banker said.Ghosh of SBI also pointed out that the 'velocity' of the Rs 2000 note is low. Essentially that means that it takes longer for a Rs 2000 note to return to the bank once its withdrawn. ""This indicates possibly currency of higher denomination/Rs 2000 is not getting adequately circulated in the economy,"" said Ghosh.As cash has come back, have consumers given up on digital transactions? Not really.RBI data on digital transactions shows that there was a jump in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation. The lack of cash availability pushed many towards digital payment options like mobile wallets.The increase has persisted even after remonetisation, the RBI said in its 'Mint Street Memo' series in November 2017. According to RBI staffers, three non-cash modes of payment picked up following demonetisation. These segments are retail electronic payments, card usage at point-of-sale terminals and cheques.""The increased usage of these three instruments during the demonetisation period has been sustained in the post-demonetisation period as well, suggestive of a fundamental shift being underway in payment habits of the Indian economy,"" said the RBI report.Representative data on electronic payments put out by the RBI on a monthly basis does show a continued increase in the volume of transactions.Trends on the value of payments, however, are more patchy at least on a month-on-month basis. To be sure, on a year-on-year basis, value of transactions continues to be higher suggesting that the increased adoption of digital payments has been sticky.(This article was originally published in BloombergQuint.)© 2015 DailyHunt ",Did Demonetisation Change India's Cash Habits? ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+quint-epaper-quint/did+demonetisation+change+india+s+cash+habits-newsid-86050722

"Sunrisers Hyderabad continued their winning run this season with an emphatic 5-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders.Set a modest total of 139, Sunrisers Hyderabad were off to an ideal start. Shikhar Dhawan and Wriddhiman Saha added a quickfire 32 off just 18 ball before Sunil Narine dismissed the latter.In his next over, Narine struck again to remove the in-form Dhawan, helping Knight Riders crawl their way back. At the end of the powerplay, the Sunrisers were 46 for 2 with skipper Kane Williamson and Manish Pandey taking charge of the chase. Kuldeep Yadav then put the hosts on top by dismissing Pandey to leave the tourists reeling at 55 for 3. At the end of ten overs, Sunrisers were 62 for 3. Williamson and Shakib Al Hasan calmed down the nerves in the dressing room.It looked like the Sunrisers would get home easily when Williamson and Shakib were batting. However, the game turned on its head when both of them departed in quick succession, leaving their side reeling at 119 for 5. The equation was finally down to 13 off the last two overs. Yusuf Pathan and Deepak Hooda then took the team home with 6 balls remaining.Earlier in the game, the Knight Riders lost wickets at regular intervals and ended up with a sub-par score. The experiment to promote Robin Uthappa as opener backfired as he was out for just 3. Chris Lynn and Nitish Rana steadied the ship for a while with a 39-run stand. The stand was broken by Billy Stanlake when he had Rana.The floodgates opened when Shakib Al Hasan dismissed Sunil Narine for 9 with the scoreboard reading 79.

"The state Congress had earlier decided against giving him the ticket after his son generated negative publicity with the alleged assault on a youth at a high-end pub in Bengaluru two months ago.  However, after scouting for a suitable candidate who could replace Haris, the ruling Congress seems to have fallen back on the two-time MLA to win the seat again. ""All surveys conducted by us predict Haris' win. He is still popular in the constituency. The BJP which is talking against corruption has fielded five candidates who went to jail during its last regime. In Haris' case, the MLA is innocent. He is facing no cases. The government has taken the strictest possible action against the son. He is in jail. We can't punish the father for his son's sins,"" a senior Congress leader said. After the Congress declared candidates for 218 seats at one go on Sunday night, Haris, whose name was not on the list, had allegedly threatened to quit the party and join the JD(S).Not ready to lose even a single seat in this 'do-or-die' battle for Karnataka, the Congress asked him not to quit and wait for a few more days.Haris' son Mohammad Nalapad was expelled from the Youth Congress two months ago after the assault which hit national headlines. The Karnataka High Court dismissed his bail application and the state government filed a caveat in the Supreme Court opposing his bail.Haris is a two-time MLA from Shanthinagara, a Muslim, Christian and Dalit-dominated Assembly seat in Bengaluru.Renowned historian Ramachandra Guha, a resident of the constituency, had opposed Haris' re-nomination.The Congress now hopes that re-nominating Haris doesn't lead to more trouble.  © 2015 DailyHunt ","Congress to Field NA Haris Again, Says 'Why Punish Father for Son's Sins' ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/india+press+agency-epaper-indpres/congress+to+field+na+haris+again+says+why+punish+father+for+son+s+sins-newsid-86033625

A confident, professional woman flanked by men who are not lecheroulsy staring at her.  The reactions to the tweet, however, were very diverse. Several users disagreed with Ashwaq Masoodi, stating that it was indeed very 'normal' to see women not being stared at by men around her.Shockingly, it happens a lot. I know, it’s crazy. It’s almost like not all men ever just leer at women with crazy lust thoughts. I know, I know, I sound like a crazy person describing heaven, but it’s real! I swear!

Ever! Your personal experiences maybe born out of working with people of your religion. In my world, and in the world of many professional women I know, it’s all the time. But that doesn’t mean we don’t take a moment because our experiences are not everyone’s.  Here is one. And these are all heads of states of NAM.  Uhhh All The Time? All the time.  While others defended Masoodi by claiming that her opinion could have been shaped by the current socio-political environment in India, and hailed Rajawat for her fearless attitude.A rare phenomenon everywhere irrespective of cast creed colour region or religion. Alas! In a heroine centric Bollywood movie of course. in reality, this is a first ! We don't see it enough, that's for damn sure.

We all have seen these creatures in films and cartoons series ad enjoyed a lot. We also have heard people about their existence which has made the topic interesting to debate on. But then the question arises about their existence. Are they real ? On the Norfolk Beach in England, remains of a mermaid has found by a man who claims that the dead species was a mermaid.   Paul took some pictures of it which went viral on social media.There was a debate regarding existence of mermaid or is it just a Photoshop image ? Are we still unaware of the nature ?  According to the news, Paul has claimed that he has seen the remains of the creature which exactly looked like mermaid. One story, dating back to the 1600s, claimed that a mermaid had entered Holland through a dike, and was injured in the process. She was taken to a nearby lake and was soon nursed back to health. Many people are saying that it is just dead seal, some believe that it is just a dummy that is designed for shooting. It has been believed that These creatures lure sailors look like half bird beautiful creatures which can be seen on the rocky shoals. There is another picture which is viral on internet. It is believed that this mermaid was found dead on the shore of the sea. However, many people claim that this was just a dummy which was used in a film shooting. According to the information on the internet, mermaids are seen in many different locations in the world but so far no evidences have been found to believe that these things are based on truth. There was one more shocking news about the findings of remains of a mermaid and it was a rumour that this would be kept in museum but till now it is not hence proved that it was remains of a mermaid or not. Citizens of Israel have also seen mermaid in 2009 and this news went viral. Existence of these creatures had been in discussions and debates since ages. These half animals and half human beings are animal legends that have captured human images for ages.  The mayor of the city claimed that whosoever would prove the existence of mermaid, he/she would be rewarded with $ 1 Million. People were excited first about searching for mermaid as this was the most mysterious story to reveal and in the greed of money they started diving in the sea but nobody till date has proved their existence. Another story, from 1830 in Scotland, claimed that a young boy killed a mermaid by throwing rocks at it; the creature looked like a child of about 3 or 4, but had a salmon's tail instead of legs. The villagers are said to have buried it in a coffin, though there seems to be no historical evidence of this fishy tale.   © 2015 DailyHunt ","Does ""Jal pari"" Mermaid Actually Exist Or It's Just An Imagination,Here People Saw Her In Real ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/stressbuster-epaper-strbusen/does+jal+pari+mermaid+actually+exist+or+it+s+just+an+imagination+here+people+saw+her+in+real-newsid-74318743

But with 4 to 5 months the roads have developed more than 20,000 potholes, reported Kannada Prabha.The heavy rains have exposed the huge scam of misappropriation in BBMP alleged BJP Bengaluru Spokesman N R Ramesh. He has lodged complaints with Lokayukta, Enforcement Directorate and Anti-corruption Bureau, against the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Ministers K J George and H C Mahadevappa and other officials.Speaking at a press meet on Wednesday he released documents pertaining to misappropriation of funds in asphalting and alleged that the new 707 km long roads are totally destroyed.For various developmental projects Rs 7300 crore has been released. Of this Rs 2,075 crore are earmarked for roads. The money has been spent but the quality of civil works is extremely poor he said. The Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Minister K J George have received huge kickbacks from contractors. Minister H C Mahadevappa and PWD Additional Chief Secretary Mahendra Jain also have played major roles, he said.TVCC Report has stated that Rs15.20 crore misappropriation of funds has been noted in filling up pot holes through Python machines. To fill up potholes in main roads Rs 16.88 crores are spent.From PWD 217.43 km roads are repaired at Rs 227.74 crore and for 490 km Rs 756.11 crore are spent.

" Seven children face sexual offences every day in Kerala, the State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) data show.In January and February this year, police had registered 459 cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, a phenomenal increase from last year's 311. Over 5,000 child victims of sexual offences are awaiting justice - 2611 cases recorded last year and 2122 in 2016.The absence of special courts for their trial and delay in getting forensic reports are cited as reasons.Currently, POCSO cases go to special courts for women and children. Concerned over the low conviction rates, the KeSCPCR had last December stressed the need of strengthening child welfare committees and other legal bodies under the JJ Act for their speedy disposal.However, the terms of most CWCs are over. In Alappuzha, there is no full-fledged CWC for last six months. Considering this, social justice minister K.K. Shylaja had in September assured appropriate steps.But no promises yielded results. Child rights activists say it's high time government agencies seriously examined the lacunae.Despite the strict law, many cases still go unreported as parents are unwilling to register a case and people continue incestuous activities.The POCSO Act 2012 had upped the age of consent for girls from 16 to 18. Before the POCSO Act, only the penovaginal encounter was considered as rape with the evidence of torn hymens. Now even a child's testimony would be recorded as clinching evidence.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Seven children abused everyday in Kerala ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/seven+children+abused+everyday+in+kerala-newsid-86024950

"  With up to 39 crimes against women being reported every hour in India, women still do not feel safe in their own backyard. To ensure that Indian women feel safe, the government plans to test panic button in phones once again.The panic button feature is slated for another round of trials in Uttar Pradesh in May 2018, as reported by the Hindu . In March 2018, the first round of trials were conducted in Uttar Pradesh. The trial was assessed by the Ministries of Women and Child Development (WCD), Home Affairs, and Electronics and Information Technology.""On the basis of our learning from the first round of trial, we will make certain changes to the software and make it more user-friendly. Another trial will be conducted in U.P. in the first week of May,"" a senior official from the WCD ministry told the Hindu .In April 2016, the government said that every phone sold from 2017 must include a panic button feature that would allow women to easily access to help in an emergency. The ministry of communications and technology said that an emergency call would be triggered when the user pressed on the number five or nine. The feature would also trigger an emergency call when the power button is pressed three times in a row.Despite the installation of panic buttons in phones having been delayed due to several reasons, the project was reignited in January 2018.On January 26, 2018, Union Minister for WCD, Maneka Gandhi said that a pilot to launch the panic button feature will be tested in Uttar Pradesh.""If it works in UP, it can work anywhere,"" Gandhi said in what was a reference to the high crime rate in Uttar Pradesh. Gandhi added that the project faced an inadvertent delay due to considerable prank calls, as mentioned in a report by the Financial Express .Chetan Sanghi, joint secretary of the WCD, said that for a person using a basic phone, they only need press a designated key on the phone for the feature to be activated. However, the government is yet to notify which button would act as a panic button, according to media reports.Sanghi told PTI : ""Once, a user presses the panic button, five calls will be made to emergency number 112. Following this, five SMSs will be immediately sent to police authorities, and another three to five SMSs will be sent to family members of the victim.""Although a panic button in smartphones seems like an effective provision, its success will also be dependent on crimes against women first decreasing significantly. The courts and police authorities are already overwhelmed with scores of open or unsolved cases that involve crime against women. The emergency response time across India is also not something to boast about at present.The government should think about what happens when a person is in distress. A report in Quartz argues that when a person is in distress, the first thing that she or he might do is call out for help. In other words, in the event of an emergency, people might be in too much of a panic to remember pressing a phone button.According to research cited in Quartz, ""the accused in over 80% of rape cases are persons known to the victim."" It then becomes a debatable matter whether smartphones might truly aid women in times of distress. However, in a country with more than one billion mobile subscribers, introducing a safety feature in a mobile might just prove helpful.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Panic buttons in smartphones to undergo trial in May: here's why it is important ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/qrius-epaper-qrius/panic+buttons+in+smartphones+to+undergo+trial+in+may+here+s+why+it+is+important-newsid-86028587

"Chandigarh, April 18: Test specialist Wriddhiman Saha reckons that opening the batting for the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL) has been a big positive for him. Saha has earlier opened the batting for Kings XI Punjab and even scored a hundred in a losing cause during the 2013 IPL final against Kolkata Knight Riders.'I like to play my natural game. The coach (Tom Moody) and captain (Kane Williamson) have backed me on this and I have got opportunity to open the innings, which is a plus point.They have told me to play with freedom and play my natural shots,' Saha told PTI here. Saha has so far scored 51 runs in three games with scores of 5, 22 and 24 respectively. Asked if he would continue opening the innings, Saha replied:'This depends on team management. If I do well as an opener, I will be entrusted to take up the responsibility but if I don't come up to their expectations, then they may think of other options. But I want to even better my performance.'Saha was generous in his praise for new skipper Williamson. 'Kane is always open to suggestions from teammates during the game. He gives us freedom and he remains very relaxed, calm and brings positive vibes. Under him, our team bonding is very good'. Saha believes that even copybook shots can fetch him runs and there is no need to play unconventional shots.'I prefer to hit over the circle when opportunity comes (during the Powerplay overs). I play my regular cricketing shots and I have not come up with any unconventional stroke,' the Bengal stumper added. Saha admitted that solid show from the bowling unit has eased the pressure on the batsmen as they have not had to chase any stiff total so far.'Apart from the bowlers who are in the playing XI, we have fantastic bench strength. Bhuvi (Bhuvneshwar Kumar), Rashid Khan, Siddarth (Kaul), Shakib (Al Hasan), Billy Stanlake have been bowling well and have helped restrict the opposition to totals in the 150 region,' he said.About IPL, which is over a decade-old , Saha said, 'IPL is a great platform for any player, more so for budding players, it is such a platform where they get opportunity to rub shoulders with senior players from around the globe, which helps them to further improve their game.'Saha, who has played 32 Tests for India, revealed that he has been fond of the shorter format of the game since the beginning. He recently hit 14 sixes en route a 20-ball hundred during a T20 inter-club game in Kolkata. 'I always liked playing T20 from the start and enjoy this format. Earlier on, in KXIP, I got few opportunities to play the shorter format of the game. I also got a chance to play the Tests but whatever opportunity you get, you have to perform and my aim is to contribute and help my team win,' he said.© 2015 DailyHunt ",IPL 2018: Opening innings is big plus for me: Wriddhiman Saha ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/ipl-epaper-iplnew/ipl+2018+opening+innings+is+big+plus+for+me+wriddhiman+saha-newsid-85995461?tk=
"   Despite Andre Russell and Nitish Rana in top form for KKR, Rajasthan can fancy their chances at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, where they have a good record.Rahane and company will hope to maintain their success rate at their fortress in Jaipur. Royals have recorded back-to-back wins after Sunrisers Hyderabad thrashed them in their opener. They pipped Delhi Daredevils by 10 runs in a rain-hit encounter and then travelled away to post a convincing 19-run victory over star-studded Royal Challengers Bangalore.The undisputed star of the game was Sanju Samson, who hit a blistering a 45-ball 92 and Royals would expect him to fire again.They were able to iron out few of their flaws. Royals' batting clicked with Samson leading the charge and skipper Ajinkya Rahane too making a useful contribution. Their bowling too could sustain the pressure of onslaught by big hitters like Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers.They are on their home turf, where they have seldom lost matches, but they would still be wary of KKR, who outplayed Delhi Daredevils rather comfortably on Monday for their second win in four games. KKR lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings, but were comfortably ahead of the RCB at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.With Chris Lynn and Sunil Narine at the top and big hitters like Dinesh Karthik, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana and Andre Russell in the middle, KKR have enough fire power and depth. Their bowling too has the right balance with the deceptive Narine, the current purple cap holder in the tournament. Wily old horse Piyush Chawla and Kuldeep Yadav are capable of weaving a web around any batting side.Pacer Shivam Mavi, who rose to stardom during the recent U-19 World Cup, and Russell provide the medium pace variety to KKR.However, the tight schedule of the tournament has left KKR so drained that they have preferred to rest on Tuesday (April 17) instead of holding a practice session. The pink city, after a two and half hour rain interruption in the previous match, is under a dry and hot spell. The wicket here is a sporting one but a little bit of dryness would help the KKR spin department.

" According to a report by Thatcham Research, an independent agency working on car safety, the Volvo XC90 may be the safest car in the UK. Over 50,000 examples have been sold since its launch in 2002, and the number of XC90 occupants died in a collision is a strong ZERO.  The company has, since 2002, sold two generations of the XC90 in the UK. The new one, which was introduced in 2014, has taken safety even more seriously with standard fitments like autonomous emergency braking. Thatcham goes on to say the inclusion of AEB can possibly save up to 1,100 lives over the next decade in the UK alone.It further mentions that AEB is the most significant development in car safety since the safety belt. And just to recapitulate, the seat belt was also introduced by Volvo.    The analysis is courtesy of the data from the government and insurance companies. It's from as early as 2004 and as recent as last year. Between the period, as  mentions no fatality has been recorded in an XC90. That's a record (unless someone from Guinness feels otherwise), and since the first-generation SUV was sold till 2014, it's quite a feat for the old car. Needless to mention, with advancements made in safety systems (both active and passive), the SPA-based XC90 unsurprisingly offers more.  Safe to say, if I were in the market for a pre-owned, full-size SUV, the XC90 would always get my vote — and money.

"  India launched fast-track courts and a tougher rape law that included the death penalty after a gruesome assault on a young woman shocked the country in 2012, but crime statistics indicate the situation has got worse, not better, since then.The data was collated by Reuters amid mounting public anger over crimes against women after two horrific cases in recent months that has, once again, cast a harsh light on systemic problems plaguing the country's police and courts. The gangrape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kashmir state and the arrest of a ruling party legislator for the rape of a teenage mother in Uttar Pradesh province have sparked nationwide outrage, drawing nightmarish parallels with the gangrape and murder of a student in New Delhi six years ago.Amid the wave of anger at that time, the government promised to speed up rape trials, provide harsher penalties, including the death sentence in extreme cases, and a law against stalking.But statistics show that since 2012, reported rape cases climbed 60 per cent to around 40,000 in 2016, with child rape accounting for about 40 per cent. The conviction rate of people arrested for rape remains stuck around 25 per cent.The backlog of rape cases pending trial stood at more than 133,000 by the end of 2016, up from about 100,000 in 2012, National Crime Records Bureau data showed.In each year during that period, about 85 per cent of the total rape cases being heard remained pending.In general, conviction rates for crime against women - deaths following demands for dowry, assault, kidnapping as well as rape - are lower than for most other crimes.""The government can make a hundred laws and yet it will fail because there is no enforcement,"" said Dushyant Dave, a senior lawyer at India's Supreme Court.""It needs to take this as an epidemic and treat it accordingly, by completely overhauling the police machinery, prosecutors and the judicial system.""  Crime statistics showed that police files remain open for about a third of all rapes that were investigated for each year between 2012 and 2016.Understaffing is an issue. The government told Parliament in March, police had a sanctioned strength of nearly 2 million officers, but almost a quarter of those positions were vacant.Some of the worst accusations against the police stem from cases, like the ones in Uttar Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, where they are alleged to have bowed to pressure from people of influence to bury cases.Vappala Balachandran, a former top police officer in the western state of Maharashtra who has criticised the government's response to the recent cases, described how powerful local politicians stall police investigations.""The one weapon the politician has is the threat of transfer (of police officers) and which they routinely exercise. So the investigation is slow, improper and weak,"" Balachandran said.  So far the only policy response to the latest cases has come from Maneka Gandhi, the minister for women and child development, who has advocated applying the death penalty for rape cases where the victim is under 12 years old.Currently, the Supreme Court reserves the death penalty for extreme cases, as in the 2012 Delhi case.Five people were convicted of rape and murder in that case within nine months, a remarkably swift decision for India. Four were sentenced to death while a juvenile was freed after serving three years. A sixth accused hung himself in his cell before the trial concluded.In 2017, the top court rejected an appeal by the four sentenced to death but they remain on death row.A study by the National Law University in Delhi found that 43 death sentences were handed down for murder involving sexual violence in 2017, almost double the previous year's number.A study by Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, whose founder shared the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, reckoned that as of the end of 2016, the backlog of child sex abuses cases in the courts would take two decades to clear.Under India's Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act passed in 2012, which covers victims under 18 years, police should collect evidence within a month of the complaint being filed and the court should complete a trial within a year.""The government of India is doing its work sincerely in each and every case,"" PS Narasimha, a senior prosecutor for the federal government, told Reuters in response to a question why rape cases took so long and the conviction rates were so low.But Kohal Dev Sharma, a lawyer at the Punjab and Haryana High Court, said the Indian criminal justice system failed when it came to rape.""The procedure itself is quite lengthy that deters most victims from fighting the battle and thus the accused are set free ultimately in most of the cases,"" he said.""The procedure is traumatic for the victim who has to face a society that considers rape as a social stigma only for the victim and not the accused, due to which most victims choose to keep mum about what they go through rather than to report it.""© 2015 DailyHunt ",India's rape victims and speedy justice: Do changes in law after 2012 horror help? ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan+chronicle-epaper-deccanch/india+s+rape+victims+and+speedy+justice+do+changes+in+law+after+2012+horror+help-newsid-86058074?s=dw&ss=twt

"  If a new European law restricting what companies can do with people's online data went into effect tomorrow, almost 1.9 billion Facebook Inc users around the world would be protected by it. The online social network is making changes that ensure the number will be much smaller.Facebook members outside the United States and Canada, whether they know it or not, are currently governed by terms of service agreed with the company's international headquarters in Ireland.Next month, Facebook is planning to make that the case for only European users, meaning 1.5 billion members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will not fall under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on 25 May. The previously unreported move, which Facebook confirmed to  on Tuesday, shows the world's largest online social network is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR, which allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users' consent.That removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook's case could mean billions of dollars.The change comes as Facebook is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world since disclosing last month that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, setting off wider concerns about how it handles user data.The change affects more than 70% of Facebook's 2 billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.Facebook, like many other US technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country's low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America. The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union.Facebook said the latest change does not have tax implications.In a statement given to , Facebook played down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.""We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,"" the company said.Earlier this month, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told  in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally ""in spirit,"" but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts. Instead they will be governed by more lenient US privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Veale said. Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union's mandated privacy notices, ""because EU law requires specific language."" For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific legal terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in US law.Ireland was unaware of the change. One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans by Facebook to transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decrease Facebook's presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.Facebook released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, and they are scheduled to take effect next month.Other multinational companies are also planning changes. LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp., tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland. New terms that take effect on 8 May move non-Europeans to contracts with US-based LinkedIn Corp.LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections. ""We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,"" the company said.  © 2015 DailyHunt ",Facebook's 1.5 billion users to be out of reach of new EU privacy law ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/live+mint-epaper-livemint/facebook+s+1+5+billion+users+to+be+out+of+reach+of+new+eu+privacy+law-newsid-86075923?s=&ss=wsp
" : Taking note of the fact that the state government has been unable to implement the provisions of reservation according to the orders from the Public Service Commission, Gujarat High Court judge Paresh Upadhyay said that if the state fails in implementing the provisions, it should consider getting president's rule in the state.A petition was filed in the Gujarat high court last year complaining that the candidates falling under the reserved category were being subjected to injustice by the public service commission. The applicant claimed that state authorities were purposely not filling in the vacancies that are for those who fall under the reserved category and instead were using laws to ensure that these vacancies too go to the general category applicants.The high court demanded an answer from the state, who, in November, asked for a period of three months to respond. After the time period lapsed and the court began its hearings again, the state government asked for more time. This didn't go down well with Justice Paresh Upadhyay, who in a terse tone, ticked off the government saying the high court believes the state and the advocate general are purposely not ensuring implementation of the provisions of reservation. And if it is unable to get the provisions implemented properly, the state should consider having the president's rule over it. This statement from the Gujarat high court comes at a time when pitched battles were fought across the state in the recent times over the burning issue of reservations.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Get president's rule in the state if reservation cannot be implemented: Gujarat HC ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/mera+news+english-epaper-meraeng/get+president+s+rule+in+the+state+if+reservation+cannot+be+implemented+gujarat+hc-newsid-85758745?s=pa&ss=wsp

"India is infamously called the 'diabetes capital of the world'. With over 40 million diabetics in the country, we have a distinction of having the highest number of diabetics for any country. This has huge implications on the country's healthcare, forcing doctors, scientists and citizens to work together to manage and remediate this condition. Now, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) have some sweet news for diabetics. They have developed a polymer based bioartificial pancreas that can be implanted inside the body, thus helping in managing diabetes.Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder in which sugar levels in the blood are very high for a prolonged period. In a healthy person, the body breaks up the carbohydrates in the food, into glucose, which supplies energy. This is done with the help of a hormone called insulin, produced in the pancreas. However, in a diabetic, the body either does not make enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes), or cannot use the insulin it produces (Type 2 diabetes). In some cases, it could be a combination of both.To treat Type 1 diabetes, a condition affecting three out of 100,000 children of 0-14 years, doctors recommend the use of insulin injections, insulin pumps, or transplantation of either the whole pancreas or islet cells - part of the pancreas that produces insulin. Recently, there has been considerable progress in developing bioartificial pancreas with islet cells which mimic the function of a natural pancreas. However, a persistent roadblock has been the issue of biocompatibility - the body treats the bioartificial pancreas as a 'foreign' object, triggering the immune system's response, which can degrade the function of the artificial pancreas.In this study, the researchers have developed a bioartificial pancreas using polymer based hollow fibre membrane that is biocompatible and can also grow and sustain insulin producing cells on it. ""A hollow fibre membrane is a narrow tube about 1 mm in diameter with pores in the wall "", explains Prof. Jayesh Bellare from IIT Bombay, who led the study. ""When liquid is passed through the tube (also called lumen), the wall selectively retains certain constituents and allows others to pass through"", he says, adding that this sort of 'selective separation' is used in many processes, including dialysis.The researchers made these patented hollow fibre membranes using a polymer called polysulfone, which is known for its toughness and stability, with an additive compound called TPGS (d-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate). ""The advantage of our hollow fibre membrane is that it supports the cells to grow by mimicking the extracellular matrix in which the cells naturally grow, and simultaneously, allows insulin to reach the patient while preventing an immune reaction from cells if they are of foreign origin"", remarks Prof. Bellare.The inner side of the hollow fibre membranes developed by the researchers has pores in the nanometer range and is responsible for the selective separation of insulin. The rest of the membrane is more porous and has bigger pores which provide support. The researchers made the bio-artificial pancreas by placing together one or more hollow fibres to form a small bioreactor - a container-like structure where insulin is produced.The researchers have tested their device with both human stem cells derived from umbilical cord, as well as islet cells from pig pancreas. ""For the first time ever, we have successfully encapsulated human stem cells and porcine cells in our novel and patented material derived hollow fibre membrane"", says Prof. Bellare. The researchers then implanted these devices into diabetic mice for 30 days and found that these implants caused no abnormalities to other organs. In addition, the immune cells of the mice did not attack the implants, and blood vessels were also seen growing on the cells of the implants.The research could improve the quality of life for more than 542,000 children in the world living with Type 1 diabetes. So how far are we from seeing this bioartificial pancreas in action? ""Although there is a long way to go for making islet transplantation a cure for diabetes, but with the right material and cell type, this can become a reality"", says Prof. Bellare. As a next step, the researchers plan to continue studying the how the new device behaves in large animals. ""Much more will be needed to bring this in human trial; the basic technology has been demonstrated in our work"", he concludes.The researchers made these patented hollow fibre membranes using a polymer called polysulfone, which is known for its toughness and stability, with an additive compound called TPGS (d-α-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate).

"The Income Tax Department on Wednesday cautioned salaried class taxpayers against using illegal means like under-reporting of income or ""inflating"" deductions while filing their returns, stating violators will be prosecuted and their employers will be intimated to take action against them.The Central Processing Centre (CPC) of the department in Bengaluru, that receives and processes the Income Tax Returns (ITRs), has issued an advisory specifying such taxpayers should not ""fall prey"" to unscrupulous tax advisors or planners who help them in preparing wrong claims to get tax benefits.Calling it a ""cautionary advisory"" on reports of tax evasion by under-reporting of income or inflating deductions or exemptions by salaried taxpayers, the department said such attempts ""aided and abetted by unscrupulous intermediaries have been noted with concern"".""Such offences are punishable under various penal and prosecution provisions of the Income Tax Act,"" it said.The advisory comes in the backdrop of the investigation wing of the department, in January, unearthing a racket of extracting fraudulent tax refunds by employees of bellwether information technology companies based in Bengaluru, in alleged connivance with a tax advisor.The CBI recently registered a criminal case to probe this nexus.The tax filing season for salaried class taxpayers has just begun with the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), that frames the policy for the department, recently notifying the new ITRs.The one-page advisory added that if the department notices any fraudulent claims in their ITRs, such claims ""may be punishable under provisions of the IT Act and this may also delay issuance of their refunds.""""Taxpayers, are, therefore strictly advised not to fall prey to false promises or misadvice by unscrupulous intermediaries and submit wrong claims in their ITRs, which would be treated as cases of tax evasion.

"New Delhi, April 19: On Tuesday, media reports stated that the country has been hit hard by an 'unusual' cash crunch as ATMs failed to dispense money in various cities and towns. The cash crunch continued on Wednesday too despite the government's assurances that the situation is 'improving'. However, there is little clarity about the reasons behind ATMs drying up leading to various speculations.On Tuesday, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said there was 'more than adequate' currency in circulation and the temporary shortage in certain states was being 'tackled quickly'.'Overall, there is more than the adequate currency in circulation and also available with banks. The temporary shortage caused by the 'sudden and unusual increase' (in demand) in some areas is being tackled quickly,' he assured. The finance minister's assurance did not help much as fear of living without cash in the coming days badly haunted people. In the entire situation, the most troubling part for everyone was that the government did not give any specific reason for the sudden drying up of ATMs.On Wednesday, a Twitter thread by data cruncher from Kerala, James Wilson, highlighted various reasons behind the cash crunch.'As Government and RBI now endorsed that there is a #CashCrunch, many theories are floating in the air about the reasons for the same. @scroll_in published 15 theories about why we are facing a cash crunch now. So let me float my own theory and examine some of the theories too!' tweeted Wilson.'One of the theories is that there is an unprecedented spur in withdrawal of the money from the banks. Also people refuse to deposit money in the banks. Many factors are attributed for this theory; starting from the scary FDRI bill to Chota Modi Scams to Minimum balance looting,' Wilson wrote. Then he examined whether there was an unprecedented withdrawal from the banks in the last couple of months. However, Wilson did not find any such rise in withdrawal based on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data.Wilson in his tweet also examined currency in circulation versus nominal GDP data--the most important factor, which governs how much currency is needed in the system.He also shared a conspiracy theory behind the cash crunch.To understand the reasons behind cash crunch, go through the entire Twitter thread well.

"In India, whenever you sell a residential property and earn capital gains on it, you have to pay tax on the profit. Let's see how this works:For instance, if you purchased a property in 2013 for Rs 20 lakhs but sold it in 2017 for Rs 40 lakhs. You have to pay capital gains tax on the Rs 20 lakhs profit earned.Capital gains tax on residential property is a tax amount you have to pay when you sell a property like an apartment owned by you. This taxed is calculated on the amount of profit acquired by selling a property.The profit is the amount difference between the initial purchased value minus the value at which property is sold.   • Long term capital gains tax: You are liable to pay long term capital gains if you sell the purchased residential property after 3 years and 20% capital gains tax is applied after indexation. • Short term capital gains tax: You are liable to pay short term capital gains if you sell the purchased residential property within 3 years of the original purchase date.The government still provides you the advantage of indexation because if the property rates have increased, inflation has also increased. So, indexation is used to exactly calculate capital gains tax.  As already discussed, you are liable to pay either long term capital gains tax or short term capital gains tax.    When you sell a residential property, you can save capital gains tax by reinvesting the whole profit amount in another residential property. For this, if you have purchased a property in the time frame of previous 1 year, which is calculated from the transfer date of the property being sold, then you can get exemption under section 54.Additionally, under this section, if you have not already purchased a residential property in the previous year, you can reinvest the profit amount in next 2 year in any residential property of India. This 2-year period is calculated from the date of transfer of the property being sold.   Under the same section 54, if you initiate the construction of property within next 3 years, you can get tax exemption. This 3-year period is calculated from the date of transfer of the property being sold. Also, both the clauses, construction and reinvestment, of section 54 is applicable to only single Indian residential property.   There are various bond schemes issued by Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) which can help you in tax exemption. When you are not willing to invest in another property or you have exhausted that option, REC and NHAI bonds are a great option.However, you can only invest in first 6 months calculated from the date of transfer of the property, and the invested amount can reach to Rs 50,00,000.Additionally, from the date of transfer of the property till 3-year completion, you can't sell these bonds.   You may come across a situation where you can't purchase or construct a new residential property before the last date of return filing. In such a scenario, you can deposit the amount to be invested in capital gains account. Usually, most public banks provide the facility of capital gains account.However, you should note that this amount would be tax exempt only if it is utilized for property construction or purchase within 3 years. After the completion of 3 years calculated from the date of the property transfer, this amount will be liable to tax from that year.   The first move before taking any measure is to calculate the capital gains tax you are liable to pay. If the tax amount is too much, then look for options to save it. Investing the acquired money in capital gains bond is not an appealing option because these bonds offer low interest rates, generally, 6 per cent per year. Hence, if you still have an option of buying a new property or constructing one, we suggest you to take that option.   Many a times property rates go down and you have to suffer a loss. In such a situation, your long term capital loss after the property is sold can be cancelled with the long term capital gain that you acquired when you sold any capital asset excluding shares, mutual bonds, etc. When you can't set off full long term capital loss in one financial year, then you can set off the remaining portion for next 8 years. But, only the same head can set off this amount.   If you deal in property a lot, then you may come across a situation where you have exhausted all these options. We suggest you to pay the capital gains tax according to laws and guidelines of India. Involving in complicated procedures for saving some tax is not a good option, and staying compliant with the law is always preferable.If you are still worried about the capital gains tax, then talk to your CA (Chartered Accountant) or any tax expert for exact tax exemption method in case of high capital gains tax.  It is important to evaluate your options beforehand. Carefully, calculate the amount of capital gains tax that you have to pay and then select the most feasible option. If you have already bought a property in past one year, that is the most practical approach for saving your capital gains tax. Otherwise, always keep property construction or purchase as your first option.It is important that you make the best use of the exemptions provided, so that you reduce your tax liability. source:  © 2015 DailyHunt ",How Can You Reduce Capital Gains Tax On Residential Property? ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/oneindia-epaper-oneindia/how+can+you+reduce+capital+gains+tax+on+residential+property-newsid-85957810?s=dw&ss=twt

While interacting with the media about the same, Sangeet said, ""I was born to her by IVF in London in 1988. I was brought up in Chodavaram from age three to 27. I was with my grandmother Brinda Krishnaraj Rai's family at the age of one and two in Mumbai. My grandfather Krishnaraj Rai died in April 2017 (March), and my uncle's name in Aditya Rai.""   image source Earlier, Amar Singh had claimed Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan live separately and now Sangeet is sure about his 'mother' being separated.  He said, ""My mother got married in 2007 with Abhishek Bachchan and she is separated, living alone. I want my mom to come and live with me in Mangaluru. It's already 27 years since I separated from my family, I miss her a lot. I don't want to go to Vishakapatnam, at least I want my mother's number so that I'll be free.""   image source However, he got no written proofs to prove his claim that Aishwarya is his mother. He further added ""I'm getting enormous headache and anger at my native place, most of my relatives have manipulated things since childhood, otherwise I would have come back to my mother before itself with clear information. Due to lack of information, I could not come to my mother, so now I got all clarity. The ultimate thing is I want my mom.""This is not the first time that such a thing happened.

"A large chunk of the reimbursement part of employees working in private sector may come under taxation net as the government is said to be mulling over bring ""indirect earning"" under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The relevant amendment in the GST rules may be discussed and approved in the next meeting of the GST Council.The idea of bringing reimbursements under the GST net flows from a recent ruling of the Authority of Advance Rulings (AAR) on canteen charges. The AAR ruled that the canteen charges recovered from an employee were to GST rates.This ruling may prompt employers to stop charging for canteen services in a bid to save taxes, which, in turn, is likely to impact the salary packages.The employers would not prefer to increase the cost to company for their employees. In a case involving a Kerala-based footwear company Caltech Polymers, the AAR ruled, ""recovery of food expenses from the employees for the canteen services provided by company would come under the definition of 'outward supply' as defined in Section 2(83) of the Act, 2017, and therefore, taxable as a supply of services under GST.""Is the ruling going to impact other parts of reimbursement component of salary? ""The decisions by the Authority of Advance Rulings are not binding on the GST Council. Both are independent of each other. The AAR works under finance ministry and has a lot to do with the Income Tax department while the GST is dealt with by a separate GST Council,"" chartered accountant Manindra Tiwari told Indiatoday.com.""However, the GST Council may consider the rulings given by the AAR while considering revision in GST rules. The logic is simple: the reimbursements are not taxed because they are claimed after expenses have been made and relevant taxes already paid. But, the counter logic is that reimbursements involve earnings made indirectly and hence should be taxed,"" Tiwari further explained.There has been an argument that the companies may be making recoveries avoiding taxes through salaries of their employees without issuing due invoices. ""There is strong likelihood that some part of reimbursement may be brought under indirect taxation through GST,"" Tiwari said.If the GST Council agrees to expand the ambit of the GST to bring reimbursements under the indirect tax net, it is certainly going to burn bigger holes in the pockets of employees working in private sectors.So, reimbursements on home rentals, telephone bills, premiums for additional health insurance coverage, health check-ups, conveyance, gym, professional attires, entertainment or similar expenditure may attract GST. The corporates may soon be found restructuring salaries of their employees, to pass on the additional GST cost on to employees.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Reimbursement part of salary to come under GST?

"  A giant asteroid gave Earth a surprise close shave this week, flying by at a distance of 192,000 kilometers, just a day after astronomers discovered the object, scientists say. Nasa estimated that the asteroid measures 48 to 110 meters wide-3.6 times the size of the one that levelled 2,000 square kilometers of Siberian forest when it exploded over Tunguska in 1908. Designated 2018 GE3, made its closest approach to Earth at around 12.11am local time on 16 April (0641 GMT, 15 April) whizzing by at about half the average distance between Earth and the moon, according to Nasa's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). The asteroid is three to six times as big as one that broke up over Russia in 2013, injuring over 1,200 people and damaging thousands of buildings up to 93km away from the impact site, ' ' reported.The asteroid 2018 GE3 was first spotted on 14 April by astronomers at the Catalina Sky Survey, a Nasa programme based at the University of Arizona in the US.

"To protect innocent citizens against false criminal cases is a noble principle. It is however not a new principle that India has discovered. On the other hand, the element of 'innocence' is a subjective perception in a society where the caste system manifested through one's social status as 'pure' or 'impure, and 'high' or 'low' caste, leads to the widely accepted view that multiple forms of untouchability are a creation of God.Indian law has criminalised discriminatory behaviour under the influence of caste in the public sphere, but has refrained from upholding caste as anti-national, immoral and irreligious, even when it has failed miserably to abolish untouchability and practices such as manual scavenging after seven decades of its independence.The controversial guidelines issued by the judges of the Supreme Court in relation to the Prevention of Atrocities Act (PAA) however cannot be attributed to similar caste bias. That would amount to contempt of court. But it is curious how there is ample place in our democratic life to check caste prejudices of civil servants, political leaders and religious leaders, but not of the judiciary. In 1994, I came across a case in Dhandhuka town of Gujarat, where the police brutally beat up a Dalit youth for purchasing a stolen bicycle for Rs 200.He was confined to a police lockup for more than 36 hours. The poor man was unable to even stand up on his feet and therefore the police produced his younger brother before the magistrate as the person they had arrested. The arrested man was later rushed by family members to the government hospital, where the doctor registered the case history and informed the police. The mention of the police frightened the man and he refused to be treated.The same night the police made out a story that he had hanged himself in his own house. The man who could not even stand had raised himself so that he could hang. The case was argued in the Gujarat High Court. In my presence, when the prosecutor defended the police action, deeply perturbed by the photographs of the injuries on the deceased, the judge asked the prosecutor, 'Had there been a policeman in the place of the victim, what would you say?' The prosecutor replied without hesitation, 'My Lord, the law differs from person to person'. Next time I heard of the prosecutor, he had just been appointed a judge at the Bombay High Court. The doctor, who had recorded the injuries on the body of the victim, also turned hostile and held that his writing was a 'slip of the pen'. He was a Dalit.The police were acquitted. The law was abused, not by the Dalits but by the state prosecutor, the police and the doctor. The law in fact protected all of them but failed to protect the victim. I was often invited to deliver lectures at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal. At one such lecture on Prevention of Atrocities Act, a senior judge intervened and said, ""If we walk on the path of the Vedas and Puranas, the country does not require a law."" A sessions judge, duly promoted to the post, told me that this senior judge had advised him: 'Do not convict too many people under PAA and do not dispose of the cases speedily'. In atrocity related cases, judges often suggest an amicable settlement before the trial begins. It is not uncommon to overhear the trial court judges themselves using derogatory caste words for Dalits.The need for an anti-untouchability law was discussed, and it is recorded as part of the Poona Pact (1932), which promised that if such a law could not be enacted immediately it would be the first law in Independent India. However, the law did not come until 1955 when India enacted the Untouchability Offences Act. With the continuing and increasing crimes against Dalits, India enacted Civil Rights Protection Act, 1976, which popularly came to be known Prevention of Atrocities Act. To give more teeth to the Act, all political parties contributed to the newly amended anti-atrocities Act, 2016. The law was not amended overnight. The process took more than four years and the draft was screened by the Standing Committee of Parliament and even the Law Commission.I am sure the judges of the Supreme Court who passed the recent guidelines were aware about these developments. I have my own reservations to certain aspects caste-based reservations. I have worked for 38 years addressing the cause of untouchability and caste discrimination. I redefined Dalits as 'all those who believe and practice equality'. I am aware and have written extensively that Dalits too have caste hierarchy within and they too practice untouchability. Navsarjan was the first organization perhaps to do a comprehensive study on prevalence of untouchability as practices between Dalits and others and within the Dalits on the basis of sub-caste. I have had the personal experiences of being ex-communicated by other sections of Dalits for having eaten in the home of a Valmiki, most of whom are engaged in manual scavenging. Often, I have been accused of being a non-Dalit. But I have experienced untouchability as a child working in farms and have closely seen caste realities living in villages for many years. And yet, I firmly believe that one cannot throw away baby with the dirty bath water. Gandhi had told his inmates after bitter happenings of the Poona Pact to the effect that even if Dalits were to smash the heads of caste Hindus they should not complain for the volume of injustice for centuries that have been heaped on them. The root cause of the problem is prevalence and pervasiveness of caste system and the arms of law are too weak to annihilate it. If there is a demand to introduce caste based reservations in the judiciary at all levels, it would be logical and rational.Please read the counterpoint to this opinion here.© 2015 DailyHunt ",SC/ST Act dilution: state and police abuse the law a lot more ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/national+herald+india-epaper-natlher/sc+st+act+dilution+state+and+police+abuse+the+law+a+lot+more-newsid-85875167?s=&ss=wsp
"  Earlier this month, during a cultural event at the Press Club in Agartala, the new chief minister of Tripura, BJP's Biplab Kumar Deb, broke into a song. To the strains of a popular Hindi film song ' Dil diya hain jaan bhi denge' from the 1986 hit Karma, he improvised the lyrics to add, 'Maine socha Tripura ko sarvasrestha rajya banana hain', (I thought of making Tripura the best state in the country). The audience was much amused.This bit harmless eccentricity pales before some of Deb's other gaffes: Stating that the Chabimura rock carvings by the Gomti river in the state were 'better' than Amazon, he reportedly said, 'Under our government, the Chabimura tourist spot will become like the Amazon river basin of Africa.'In the run-up to the last assembly elections, Deb, then the state BJP chief, said at a rally in Khowai district that any vote cast in the EVMs for the CPI (M), even by the then chief minister Manik Sarkar, would go to the BJP. Deb's claim came at a time when there was a raging debate across the country over possible EVM tampering. Several complaints were filed against his comment with the Election Commission of India (ECI), leading him to pipe down, and saying his comment was taken 'out of context.'Now he has topped it all by declaring that the Internet existed in this land long before it was invented in the West. 'It is this country where communication was possible because we then had technology, Internet was there; so was the satellite communication system. It is not that internet and media wasn't available in the age of Mahabharata,' the Tripura chief minister said at a regional workshop on computerisation and reforms in the public distribution.The lampooning in the Internet — the modern one — was severe.Last month when Deb was sworn in as chief minister, he had raised hopes among many of better avenues of employment and development in the state than in the earlier Left Front regime — as promised in the Bharatiya Janata Party''s 28-page 'vision document'. But after winning initial public approval for taking some quick decisions, such as handing over cases of alleged murder of two journalists prior to the assembly polls to the Central Bureau of Investigation and setting up a committee to look into the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations for state government employees, Deb's bizarre statements have been hitting the headlines and have made him a laughing stock both in the state and outside.The Tripura Chief Minister with journalists at the Agartala Press Club on the occasion of Bengali New Year last week. Credit: Twitter/Biplab Kumar DebThe young BJP leader, who served as an RSS volunteer in Delhi for 15 years before returning to the state in 2015 to work for the party, has joined the likes of Union minister of state Satyapal Singh when he referred to Sanjaya, the charioteer in the Mahabharata, and claimed that he could narrate the goings-on in the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas in Kurukshetra to the blind king Dhritarashtra in Ayodhya because Internet and satellites existed then.'I do not know what happened in the middle age though, between the Mahabharata era and now,' he added. But now, with a prime minister who was active on social networking sites, the entire country had once again got familiar with technology after 2014, said Deb.While both conventional and social media took a few digs at Deb's outrageous claims, he got support from the state's governor, former BJP West Bengal chief Tathagata Roy who jumped to his defence and added his bit on Twitter.Roy tweeted, 'Tripura Chief Minister's observations about the happenings of the Puranic period are topical. It is virtually impossible to conceive of devices like 'Divya dristi', Pushpaka Ratha', etc. without some kind of prototype and study thereon.'Tripura Chief Minister's observations about the happenings of the Puranic period are topical. It is virtually impossible to conceive of devices like 'Divya drishti',Pushpaka Ratha',etc without some kind of prototype and study thereon— Tathagata Roy (@tathagata2) April 18, 2018 Twitteratti went into a tizzy, lapping up these bizarre statements, with some even asking Roy 'to get well soon'.Undeterred by the criticism, Deb, who trained under veteran RSS leaders Govindacharya and Krishna Gopal, instead of stepping back, reiterated what he had said. Accusing those flaying him for his comments as 'narrow minded people who want to belittle their own nation and think highly of other countries', Deb told the local media, 'Every Indian should have a common thinking that India is best and superior country all around the world.' He said his critics should 'accept the truth and should not get confused.'His comments are now legion. Last month, speaking at the Tripura Central University, he said he wanted to see the institution grow like the Nalanda and went on to claim that Chanakya taught at the ancient university situated in present-day Bihar. Not just that, Chanakya taught at Taxila, the ruins of which are found in present-day Pakistan.This past April 18, taking part at an event in Agartala Town Hall, the chief minister also claimed the famous Chinese traveller Hieun Tsang who visited India in the ancient times was a journalist.But it was his Internet claim that has made him a national figure. A day after defending his Internet argument, Deb, interacting with reporters, sought some time to fulfill his 'dreams' for Tripura. But not before sharing another loaded gem from his book of wisdom: 'A person who is not a good homemaker, can't keep his own family happy, can never make the country happy, can't be a good chief minister, neither can he be a good prime minister.'© 2015 DailyHunt ",Tripura CM Biplab Deb's Gaffe-Shop is Making National Headlines ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+wire+english-epaper-wireng/tripura+cm+biplab+deb+s+gaffe+shop+is+making+national+headlines-newsid-86082192

"How many of us want to lose weight? Everyone, right? Okay, at least most of us do.But how many of us love to eat bitter gourd? Possibly no one. There's a reason we don't like bitter gourd - well, its bitter!But what if we told you that this bitter tasting vegetable can help you lose weight naturally? Yes, bitter gourd or karela is possibly one of the most nutritious vegetables you can consume.So, how does this super vegetable help you lose those inches? Does drinking karela juice everyday help or should you consume it raw?Here are some answers to help you burn those extra kilos naturally: Guess the number of calories in 100 grams of karela? As low as 20 calories. Raw bitter gourd pods have only 17 calories per 100 grams while 1 cup of bitter gourd juice has 32 calories. Amazing, right?Karela is also low in fat and carbohydrates. This makes it the perfect food for weight loss.As per Ayurveda, we should consume foods of all tastes - sweet, sour, salty, bitter etc, but due to our aversion to the bitter tasting foods, we tend to exclude them from our everyday diets.Nutritionist Kavita Devgan explains:Bitter gourd is great for diabetic patients as it helps regulate the insulin levels in the bloodstream. A little bit of karela juice early morning on an empty stomach is recommended for diabetics. It contains a chemical called 'charantin' which is known to reduce high blood glucose levels.But it is also works wonders for the people who wish to lose weight as it stabilises the blood sugar levels in the body.Bitter gourd is rich in soluble fibre which prolongs the digestion process and keeps you feeling full for a longer period of time. This in turn prevents you from binge-eating.The other reason why bitter gourd is so filling is that it has high water content - approximately 89-94 percent - which makes it calorie-free and a great food for summers.Bitter gourd juice is an excellent source of antioxidants which helps in the secretions of enzymes that aid digestion.If you find yourself struggling to gulp down this bitter drink, then add some honey or jaggery to it. Even a few drops of lemon juice will help decrease the bitterness.© 2015 DailyHunt ",5 Ways in Which Bitter Gourd aka Karela Can Help You Lose Weight ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/fit-epaper-fit/5+ways+in+which+bitter+gourd+aka+karela+can+help+you+lose+weight-newsid-86060232?s=a&ss=fb

"Alia Bhatt is feeling the blues. Ethereal, celestial dusty tones and also the deepest hues of the sky. We are seeing a lot of OOTD (outfit of the day) posts on Instagram of the actor rocking a slew of blue looks, including this laidback denim jacket-blue jeans French Connection look from Tuesday.  A post shared by  (@aliaabhatt) on  Alia's versatile and practical outfit is especially chic because of her jeans jacket in a soft blue shade that goes with everything: Whether you wear it over printed dresses to add a casual flair or over ripped jeans for an understated look. Proving a denim jacket is the way to go for all your summer fetes - brunches, office parties, birthdays, or romantic dates - Alia paired hers with sky-high ankle-strap heels (but it will look just as cute with a pair of flat sandals or all-white sneakers).Tie your hair in a sleek low ponytail and add a swipe of pale pink lipstick for an effortless summer get-up, à la Alia. And her statement sunglasses? How summery and fun.   A post shared by  (@shnoy09) on  While the Student of the Year star has pretty much experimented with the whole rainbow, she is lately working almost entirely-blue outfits in countless different ways. From breezy, oh-so elegant anarkalis that make her glow with confidence to easy, sophisticated denims co-ords that make a statement.   A post shared by  (@hairbypriyanka) on  Read on to see all of the unique ways Alia's showed off the blue section of her wardrobe, as she promotes her upcoming film Raazi. And let her inspire you to experiment with the colour this summer: Be it by going head-to-toe with pieces of the exact same shade of blue or teaming blue with other colours. The only question is: How are you going to wear it?  A post shared by  (@shnoy09) on  On Monday, Alia wore a head-to-toe navy blue ensemble. Her House of Kotwara anarkali, designed by Meera and Muzaffar Ali had just the right of pop of colour for those who prefer to stick to black. The shape of this halter on Alia is super flattering and the floral embroidered details are subtle but look-oh-so-fancy.   A post shared by  (@shnoy09) on  This look is the perfect alternative to an-all black look, which so many love. It's chic, effortless, and, in our opinion, totally summer appropriate. Cute embellished juttis from Needledust too.   A post shared by  (@anitadongre) on  Alia started Raazi promotions with a sweet anarkali from designer Anita Dongre's spring-summer 2018 collection, Songs of Summer. Her floor-touching white and blue print ensemble had an embellished plunging neckline and reminded us just why blue is her colour.   A post shared by  (@shnoy09) on  The simplicity of this look makes you appreciate Alia's beauty so much more. The elegance and allure of this cornflower blue design ticks all the summerwear boxes and those Azotiique earrings, aren't they beautiful? With such a look, you won't look like you're trying too hard to stand out, but you will - every time.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Alia Bhatt will convince you this is the only colour to wear right now ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/alia+bhatt+will+convince+you+this+is+the+only+colour+to+wear+right+now-newsid-86029909
  Maintaining sanitation levels in areas around Secunderabad has become a herculean task for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) authorities. © 2015 DailyHunt ,"GHMC toilets at petrol bunks, hotels lie in neglect ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/thehansindia-epaper-hans/ghmc+toilets+at+petrol+bunks+hotels+lie+in+neglect-newsid-86020767?s=a&ss=pd
"Even as Tamil Nadu is in the throes of a sex scandal that has smeared the highest levels of government and higher education, the sheer courage of the women who spoke up has gone largely unnoticed.It was an audio recording from March, where Nirmala Devi, a college professor allegedly attempted to lure women students into sex work in return for academic and financial gain, that eventually trapped her and led to her arrest on Monday. She boasted of 'access' to the Governor and promised a monthly income. All this and more for a 'good opportunity' that was awaiting them.Despite the students categorically rejecting Nirmala Devi's 'offer', the professor continued to hound them over WhatsApp. On March 15, four women students of the Devanga College of Arts in Virudhunagar walked into the women's welfare committee of the institution that provides them with ""information on rights and personal hygiene"" and told a faculty member that they had been hounded and badgered by Assistant Professor Nirmala Devi of the Mathematics Department. This is the only recourse they had in a college that had failed to constitute the Internal Complaints Committee as mandated by law.A full six days later, the Professor was suspended on March 21 by the Principal of the college- a fact that students of the college were not even aware of.TNM caught up with M Thangapandian, an advocate who published the notorious audio recording on Aruppukottai Arangal, a Facebook page that deals with local social issues. He says, ""A few of the students' friends approached me because they realised the college was trying to suppress the suspension. They know I'm an advocate so they were able to approach me. And a lot of youngsters follow our Facebook page so this could be addressed in a genuine manner. We thought we would dig deeper and find out who the powerful in this story are.""Thangapandian tells us that as soon as he published the audio recording, it was picked up first by the Tamil magazine Nakkeeran. ""Aruppukkottai gets 1000 copies of the magazine. That week's edition was entirely bought out by the college so no one would be able to read it.""One of the students' parents approached Thangapandian, who reassured them that they would get justice. ""With the kind of media attention the issue has gotten, their families are very nervous.""The families even requested the media for privacy through Thangapandian.The students, however, fear for their future and how this would affect them as students of the college. ""After the story broke and before Nirmala Devi was arrested, the students were called by the college management and 'counselled'. They have been asked to say that it was only Nirmala Devi who approached them and no names of the management must be taken.""In yet another blow to their privacy and total disregard for the great personal risk at which they had spoken up, the college mentions them by name in the official complaint to the police. ""The students or their families were not consulted. The students didn't want their names mentioned anywhere. They took it to the principal and it was meant to be a complaint on behalf of the college,"" says Thangapandian.Making a plea on behalf of the students, Thangapandian says, ""Their phones have been confiscated and their families are being monitored so it is important to understand what they are going through.""© 2015 DailyHunt ",How 4 bravehearts and their families fought against the odds to report Nirmala Devi ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+news+minute-epaper-newsmin/how+4+bravehearts+and+their+families+fought+against+the+odds+to+report+nirmala+devi-newsid-86075734
"The researchers and environmentalists argue that the idlis prepared using plastic covers instead of cotton cloth while baking is the potential threat to human life as plastic emits harmful microns in heat. This micron, when makes an entry into the human system, can cause cancer.Professor and Head of The Department Chemistry, CMR Institute of Technology, Dr Phani Kumar Pullela said, the new journal of medicine has already made publications of the harmful impact of plastic coming into contact with humans.Food and beverage containers, some disposable plates, and toiletry bottles made of plastic have chemicals.Research suggests that all plastics may release chemicals if they're scratched or heated. Research also strongly suggests that at certain exposure levels, some of the chemicals in these products, such as Bisphenol A (BPA), may cause cancer in people. ""The same concept has to be applied in cooking idli. If the idli is cooked using thin plastic, there is a high chance of suffering from diseases including cancer. The plastic residues may leak into food substance when exposed to heat. The plastic emits harmful carcinogens when food is cooked or is heated in plastic items. In the long run, people will get infected with cancer as well,"" said Dr Pulella.Agreeing with Dr Pullela, Dr Linge Gowda, Director of KIDWAI Memorial Institute of Oncology, says, it is beyond an iota of doubt that plastic when exposed to heat releases harmful carcinogens which cause cancer.""Consumption of food cooked in aluminium, steel, earthen pot or copper is safe. We have noticed people using plastic glass to drink roadside tea, and also people eat food like idli cooked using a plastic sheet in the cookware. The hotels and roadside stalls were earlier using a cotton cloth to avoid batter getting struck to idly cooking plates, but now, the plastic sheet is being used in most of the eateries. In the long run, this will have an impact on health. Hence we suggest that the local and municipal authorities must impose penalty on such eateries,"" he said.Dr Nirmal Buggi, Chief Health Officer of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, has directed all the 198 health inspectors to check eateries in their respective jurisdiction and impose penalty for use of plastic in cooking.""The plastic above 40 micron and micro wave safe vessels are only allowed to cook and serve food when it comes to use of plastic. The roadside shops are aware that using such plastic in cooking and also while covering the serving plate can cause negative effects on health. Yet, they do not comply with BBMP rules,"" he said.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Shocking: Your favourite idli can cause cancer ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/shocking+your+favourite+idli+can+cause+cancer-newsid-69060145?s=wa&ss=wsp

"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a scathing attack on the Congress and Rahul Gandhi after the Supreme Court (SC) rejected pleas to probe the death of judge BH Loya on Thursday, 19 April.The BJP slammed the opposition Congress, alleging that Rahul Gandhi had an ""invisible"" hand behind the petitions that tried to use the judiciary to malign the image of Amit Shah.Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that Rahul Gandhi should be ""ashamed"" of conspiring against BJP President Amit Shah, and the Indian judiciary and democracy.Patra then went on to say that the Congress engages in all sorts of conspiracies after its family loses power, he alleged that Congress made an attempt to use the judiciary for political purposes and hit a ""new low"" in Indian politics.Meanwhile, the Congress party addressed a press conference of its own, deeming the apex court's verdict as a 'sad day in India's history'.Addressing the media, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that despite there having been 'discrepancies' in Loya's post-mortem report, the SC's decision to not announce a probe has left many questions unanswered.Stating that Congress was committed to the cause of an independent inquiry, Surjewala said:Surjewala also attacked the BJP for targeting the opposition over the verdict.The issue of Loya's death had come under spotlight in November last year, after media reports quoting his sister fueled suspicion about the circumstances surrounding it and its link to the Sohrabuddin case, which he was hearing before he died.While dismissing the plea for an independent probe, the top court on 19 April, said that with these petitions it becomes clear that a real attempt and a frontal attack was made on the independence of the judiciary.The apex court said frivolous and motivated litigation has been filed to settle political rivalry.© 2015 DailyHunt ","Judge Loya Case: BJP, Cong Take Digs at Each Other Over SC Verdict ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+quint-epaper-quint/judge+loya+case+bjp+says+rahul+gandhi+tried+to+malign+amit+shah-newsid-86056523

" Vadodara: The All-India Banks Employees Association (AIBEA) has threatened to launch an agitation on the cash crunch issue, its general secretary CH Venkatachalam said today.""Mere statements will not help. Concrete, immediate action is needed to improve the supply of currency notes,"" Venkatachalam told journalists.  For the past few weeks, banks in many states, especially those in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra and the poll-bound Karnataka have been facing severe cash shortages, with many ATMs showing 'no cash' signboards.Because of this, bank employees are facing the wrath and anger of the public, said Venkatachalam. ""Customers are shouting at and abusing bank staff for no fault of theirs,"" he added.  While the RBI has claimed that there is enough printing and supply of cash in the system, government tried to blame it on the unusual spike in cash demand due to the ongoing farm procurement.Blaming the government and the Reserve Bank for inadequate supply of currency notes, he said in fact the problem started with the decision to print Rs 2,000 notes after the note-ban announcement in November 2016.  ""If the Rs 1,000-notes were withdrawn to prevent black money and cash hoarding, it is only obvious now that both have become easier with the Rs 2,000 notes,"" he said.Blaming the central bank for the poor cash management that has lead to the present shortage, he wondered if the RBI governor is to be believed where has all the money gone.  ""The RBI governor has made a statement that adequate amount of currency notes are printed. But then where have these notes gone? Are they not to investigate? Are they not to ensure that banks have enough cash to meet the requirements of customers?"" he asked.He also alleged that even 16 months since the demonetisation, many ATMs are still not re-calibrated for the newly designed banknotes.""This is adding to the problem,"" he said, and noted that the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, pending for Parliamentary approval, has also added to the problem.The FRDI Bill seeks to bail out a failing bank with the depositors' money if the proposed resolution corporation deems it to do so and can refer a bank for liquidation. He said there is fear among the public about the proposed bail-in clause in the Bill.  Therefore, he demanded that government immediately withdraw the Bill.The present cash shortage has created more doubts and fears among the public whether all is well with banks. ""It is the duty of the RBI and government to dispel these fears,"" he said.© 2015 DailyHunt ",Bank unions threaten to go on agitation over ATMs cash crunch issue ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/live+uttarpradesh+english-epaper-liveupen/bank+unions+threaten+to+go+on+agitation+over+atms+cash+crunch+issue-newsid-86062532?s=a&ss=pd

" Thrissur: The 'oottupura' (temple dining hall) attached to the famed Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple here will henceforth be opened to all, including non-Hindus.In a major decision, the management of the temple, where non-Hindus are barred from offering worship, has opened the portals of its 'oottupura' to everyone, cutting across religion.The Guruvayur Devaswom, the management, also lifted the restrictions on dress code imposed at the dining hall and allowed devotees to wear shirts, pants and footwear there.A major pilgrim centre, Guruvayur Temple was in the news recently over whether to allow ardent devotees like legendary carnatic vocalist K J Yesudas, a Roman Catholic, to offer prayers there.While a section of society wants Yesudas, who has sung hundreds of devotional songs praising 'Guruvayurappan', the presiding deity of the shrine, be allowed, orthodox groups want the tradition of restricting the entry of non-Hindus to continue.A Padma Bhushan awardee, Yesudas had expressed his ardent desire to visit the shrine and offer worship several times.Hundreds of devotees from and outside the state have 'prasada oottu', the delicious temple feast, every day at the oottupura of the centuries-old shrine.When contacted, Devaswom Chairman K B Mohandas said the decision in this regard was taken in a meeting yesterday and it came into force with immediate effect.A board saying non-Hindus are not allowed, displayed in front of the dining hall, was also removed, he said.""The dining hall was located inside the temple complex earlier. The restrictions for non-Hindus to enter the hall continued even after it was shifted outside the west side of the shrine complex some time back,"" he told PTI.""We have removed the restriction now,"" he said.  © 2015 DailyHunt ",Guruvayur temple opens up for all; Non-Hindus can now have 'prasada oottu' at Guruvayur temple ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/evartha-english-epaper-evarthen/guruvayur-temple-opens-up-for-all-nonhindus-can-now-have-prasada-oottu-at-guruvayur-temple-newsid-86047065?s=a&ss=pd
"	​​​																																																								 																								Unwilling to settle for the sole offer made by Liberty House, lenders to ABG Shipyard have decided to try and attract more buyers in a second round of bidding. Consequently, prospective buyers can come up with resolution plans to revive the bankrupt shipbuilding firm. While the deadline for the completion of resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, expires on April 28, the courts are expected to give lenders a grace period. A formal announcement to this effect as made on Wednesday by the resolution professional. The committee of creditors (CoC) is understood to have rejected the bid from Liberty House on the grounds that the price of Rs 2,200 crore offered is lower than the amount that can be recovered if the business is liquidated.While it is not clear how ABG was allowed to pile up loans of a staggering Rs 19,000 crore, the fact is lenders today are saddled with the highest stake in the firm of 49%. The original promoters — led by chairman Rishi Agarwal — have little skin in the game with a shareholding of just 9%. At the end of March 2016, a shareholding of 33.26% was held by ABG International and other promoters. ABG’s net losses in 2016-17 were a whopping Rs 5,716 crore on minuscule revenues of Rs 16 crore.Despite the lenders sanctioning a generous corporate debt restructuring package in March 2014, with a lower interest rate, lenient repayment terms with a two-year moratorium to boot, the management was unable to revive the company.A strategic debt restructuring was proposed in August 2016, but did not go through because minority shareholders opposed it. The company owes ICICI Bank around Rs 5,303 crore, IDBI Bank Rs 2,573 crore and State Bank of India Rs 2,316 crore; the rest is owed to other lenders. This is the second time that Liberty House’s bid for ABG Shipyard has been turned down. A spokesperson for Liberty House — a London-based metals group — declined to comment on whether the company would submit another bid.

"The Income Tax Department on Wednesday cautioned salaried class taxpayers against using illegal means like under-reporting of income or ""inflating"" deductions while filing their returns, stating violators will be prosecuted and their employers will be intimated to take action against them.The Central Processing Centre (CPC) of the department in Bengaluru, that receives and processes the Income Tax Returns (ITRs), has issued an advisory specifying such taxpayers should not ""fall prey"" to unscrupulous tax advisors or planners who help them in preparing wrong claims to get tax benefits.Calling it a ""cautionary advisory"" on reports of tax evasion by under-reporting of income or inflating deductions or exemptions by salaried taxpayers, the department said such attempts ""aided and abetted by unscrupulous intermediaries have been noted with concern"".""Such offences are punishable under various penal and prosecution provisions of the Income Tax Act,"" it said.The advisory comes in the backdrop of the investigation wing of the department, in January, unearthing a racket of extracting fraudulent tax refunds by employees of bellwether information technology companies based in Bengaluru, in alleged connivance with a tax advisor.The CBI recently registered a criminal case to probe this nexus.The tax filing season for salaried class taxpayers has just begun with the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), that frames the policy for the department, recently notifying the new ITRs.The one-page advisory added that if the department notices any fraudulent claims in their ITRs, such claims ""may be punishable under provisions of the IT Act and this may also delay issuance of their refunds.""""Taxpayers, are, therefore strictly advised not to fall prey to false promises or misadvice by unscrupulous intermediaries and submit wrong claims in their ITRs, which would be treated as cases of tax evasion. In the cases of such wrong claims by the government/PSU employees, the reference would be made to the concerned vigilance division for action under conduct rules,"" it added.The advisory added that the department possesses an ""extensive risk analysis system"" that is aimed at identifying persons who are non-compliant and aim to subvert the trust based-system ""envisioned"" while processing of ITRs at the CPC, which it said is automated and devoid of any human interface.""In all such cases of high risk, the department may examine and verify the details submitted by taxpayers in their ITR subsequent to the processing of returns,"" it said.It also asked tax planners and advisors to ""confine their advice to taxpayers within the four corners of the IT Act"" and warned that the violators will be prosecuted and such instances will also be referred to enforcement agencies like the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for criminal prosecution. © 2015 DailyHunt ",IT warns salaried class against filing wrong ITRs ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/deccan-herald-epaper-deccan/it-warns-salaried-class-against-filing-wrong-itrs-newsid-86016887?s=a&ss=wsp

"Real Star Upendra is trying to put forth his ideas for change and is encouraging people for a different kind of politics which he calls Prajakeeya. He launched his party Karnataka Pragnyavanta Janata Paksha on October 31. However, this party was already registered in the name of Mahesh Gowda.The party was originally registered by Mahesh Gowda. However, he gifted it to Upendra as Upendra's objectives were in tandem with the Party.Mahesh Gowda is said to be an owner of an industry. He had registered the Karnataka Pragnyavanta Janata Paksha with the Election Commission in 2015.He is said to be actor Upendra's ardent fan too.   Mahesh Gowda's wife had contested for the BBMP election from Hegganahalli ward as an independent candidate under Karnataka Pragyavanta Janata Paksha (KPJP) but had lost the election.When Upendra came up with a party and tentatively named it as Uttama Praja Paksha and revealed the aims of the party, Mahesh Gowda had a discussion with the star and agreed to give away the party to Upendra.It was said that the ideology and aims of Mahesh Gowda and Upendra were same. Another reason cited was that it would take another six months to register a new party. But Upendra wants his people to contest from KPJP in the next Assembly elections scheduled to be held at the beginning of May next year.Thus registering a new party will not be feasible at this time (just months before next elections) and that's why the talks were held between Mahesh Gowda who readily agreed to give away his party to Upendra. © 2015 DailyHunt ","Upendra is not the founder of KPJP, here are details about the real founder ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/upendra+is+not+the+founder+of+kpjp+here+are+details+about+the+real+founder-newsid-75970499
"Every few months, news from the Women and Child Development Ministry gives an indication that the minister, Maneka Gandhi, is interested in overhauling India's nutrition scheme for children and women.Her stand is at odds with her own ministry, with orders of the Supreme Court and with legislation. Yet she has continued to push for the replacement of fresh, hot, cooked food with 'nutrient packets' in India's Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS). The Hindu reported last week that once again, Gandhi has asked for her ministry to consider 'energy-dense, factory-made' nutrient packets as take-home ration to beneficiary families, instead of sourcing fresh and cooked food from women's self-help groups, which is the status quo.Some 188 academics, activists and people working in the area of health and nutrition for children and women have written to her with their concerns over her continued push towards processed food. Their letter reads,For years, the Right to Food Campaign has been fighting the battle against the role of private contractors in the supply of supplementary nutrition in the ICDS. In state after state it has been seen that the unholy nexus between the contractors and politicians/bureaucrats result in central contracts worth hundreds of crores for supply of food to ICDS. The quality of food supplied to the centres is compromised while companies make profits from the meagre allocation on supplementary nutrition. Recent scams related to the above have been brought to light in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The letter has been signed by people at many well-known organisations, such as the Right to Food Campaign, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, the Public Health Resource Network, Sahaj, Sahayog, Saheli, the All India Democratic Women's Association, Haq, the Centre for Equity Studies, Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest, Greenpeace, National Law School of India University, Ambedkar University and the Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation.India's ICDS programme discharges two important functions simultaneously: It provides food to infants (children under the age of six) and women who are pregnant or lactating.On the Global Hunger Index, India was placed at a shameful 100 out of 119 countries last year.The right to food in India has been upheld by the Supreme Court in various orders, drawing from a public interest litigation filed in 2001 by the People's Union for Civil Liberties. The Supreme Court appointed a monitoring group to ensure that their directions are indeed implemented. The court has also passed very specific directions over the years, including one that banned private contractors from taking control of the ICDS supply chain.Now, Gandhi's proposal would bring private contractors into the ICDS.In 2013, the Indian parliament enacted the National Food Security Act. The new letter addressed to Gandhi reminds her of the existing legal framework on the issue: 'We request you not to give in to the interest of profit and continue to abide by the letter and spirit of the National Food Security Act in providing locally made take home rations to children in the anganwadi centres.' The Wire had reported in September 2017, that Maneka Gandhi, NITI Aayog and her ministry were all at odds with each other on this issue.At that time as well, Gandhi had been recommending nutrient packets to her ministry. NITI Aayog was recommending cash transfers and an associated pilot project. But the Women and Child Development Ministry itself had been publicly discussing its achievements in providing fresh cooked food. The ministry has also filed affidavits in various courts saying that they will continue to uphold the provision of fresh cooked food. @Narendramodi_PM @Manekagandhibjp @MinistryWCD @NITIAayog Is the WCD contemplation of involving manufacturers against the aspiration of the Department and Supreme Court's directions? and Is packaged food prepared months ago more nutritious? pic.twitter.com/DPRKBGBZQg — Dipika Sahani (@dipika_sahani) April 17, 2018 Shortly after, The Wire also reported that the government had again clarified that the latter was not doing away with fresh cooked food. Then, in October 2017, the women and child development ministry issued a press release reiterating that it was not doing away with cooked food.There is no proposal to discontinue Supplementary Nutrition Program under ICDS and replace it with Conditional Cash Transfer: @MinistryWCD pic.twitter.com/OdqjfK6bdA — Ministry of WCD (@MinistryWCD) October 12, 2017 Rakesh Srivastava, secretary to the Women and Child Development Ministry, had said in September 2017, 'There is no plan to remove hot cooked meals. It is a part of the National Food Security Act. The role of anganwadis in cooking hot meals for children and women is specified in Section 5 and 6 of the Act. The central ministry provides only guidelines to the states. But states cannot violate the Act. If they do, they can be taken to court.'On Thursday, the NITI Aayog conducted the first meeting of the 'National Council on India's Nutrition Challenges.' The body's vice chairman, Rajiv Kumar, said, 'NITI Aayog will work to rank the states on their efforts to reduce malnutrition.' #NITIAayog will work to rank the states on their efforts to reduce malnutrition.

A clash with security force personnel had reportedly left 15 students injured.  Though protests over the Kathua incident have been on for the past few days, participation of students actively started since Monday.

"Kolkata Knight Riders defeated Rajasthan Royals by 7 wickets in Jaipur on Wednesday, 18 April 2018. KKR rode to victory off a winning six from captain Dinesh Karthik.Skipper Dinesh Karthik and Nitish Rana combined for an unbroken 61-run partnership for the fourth wicket to ease past the line. Karthik hit a six off Ben Laughlin to secure the win in style.KKR never looked in trouble despite losing out-of-form Australian opener Chris Lynn (0) in only the second ball of their innings, with off-spinner Krishnappa Gowtham (2/23) flattening his stumps with a ball that spun sharply into the batsman who tried to cut.Uthappa and Narine then came together for a 69-run stand for the first wicket. Uthappa looked in imperious form, hitting Jaydev Unadkat for three fours in the fifth over.Earlier, KKR bowlers picked up wickets at regular intervals to restrict RR to 160/8 in 20 overs.In the last over, young fast bowler Shivam Mavi (1/40) bowled three wide balls and Chris Lynn dropped Dhawal Kulkarni (3) but he was later run out.Rahane then took on Narine, the most economical bowler in the IPL so far, hitting him for four back-to-back fours straight up. The India Test team vice-captain swept and drove the West Indian mystery spinner with aplomb to garner 18 runs off the over.Sanju Samson followed suit soon after, picking out Kuldeep at deep midwicket off Mavi and just when Short was looking to accelerate, Rana castled him with a slider in the next over to break the 36-run third wicket partnership with Rahul Tripathi.The inaugural IPL winners never recovered from there and were short by 10-20 runs.(With inputs from IANS) is now on WhatsApp. To receive handpicked stories on topics you care about, subscribe to our WhatsApp services.

"   Education sets an individual free. It is heartening to see private establishments like Peepul Foundation working together with Delhi's government schools to bring world-class education to their students. In an interview with Qrius, Ms Kruti Bharucha, the CEO of Peepul, talks about the foundation and its goals. She has worked in premier institutions like The World Bank, McKinsey & Co. and CEB Inc., following which she became the Country Director for Ark India, to heed her passion for ensuring quality education to children everywhere.    I can remember being asked at the age of ten what I wanted to be when I grew up. Being a child of two economists, the expected answer was likely a professional degree. However, I wanted to reduce the inequality I saw in India and thought that building schools for the children that didn't receive a chance to go to school was one way to solve that problem.  2013 was a decision point for me. I was in the running to become a Managing Director at CEB but paused to really ask myself what I wanted to do in my career and professional life. The development sector kept pulling me back and I knew that my answer would be the same as what I would have said when I was ten years old.  For me, there was no time like the present and moving to the sector when I was in the prime of my career could really make a difference. Life has a way of bringing opportunities to you when you really want something and so, in 2014, I was appointed Country Director for Ark India.    Our motto is to transform children's lives through quality education. We want every child to realise their true potential irrespective of their background.  The issue is no more just getting children into school, it is making sure they have a high-quality education. 70% of the poorest children in India, most of whom rely on government schools, leave primary school without even basic reading or writing skills. Although government schools had good infrastructure, large classrooms and an adequate area for playing, parents were increasingly dissatisfied with the poor accountability structures and falling standards of education delivered in these schools. As a result, teachers feel disempowered, students feel apathetic, and parents feel frustrated.  Our work aims to be disruptive and address these low literacy levels by creating exemplary partnership schools within the government system, which will raise the expectations and revitalise the quality of public education in India.    Our vision is to create a high-performing school network which will raise expectations and education standards. Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu showed the country what excellence means for their sport by performing at the highest levels and winning medals at the Olympics. They raised the bar and generated enthusiasm and interest for badminton in India. Parents now send their children to badminton academies with the hope of them becoming the next PV Sindhu. We want our schools to be centres of excellence that raise the bar for quality education in India.  What makes us different is that we are continuously learning and listening to feedback, course correcting and strengthening our programmes where we can to have a greater impact on learning outcomes.    Our education model is based on a rigorous approach to teaching and learning.  Our teachers are recruited from top colleges through an extremely rigorous selection process. They receive extensive training in practical, effective techniques for teaching young children the basics of language, reading, writing and mathematical concepts such as number, size and shape. Our focus is on mastery of Mathematics, English and Hindi. We have developed a strong curriculum, using the best international practices and guidance from reputed Indian experts.  We make sure we work with every child and develop individual learning plans for them. Colourful and interesting teaching-learning materials are used to ensure children are engaged. Rather than rote learning, which is the common practice, we give our pupils opportunities to learn through creative and social activities, which builds their confidence and imagination. We teach them how to behave, to respect each other and their teacher.  Our training for teachers focuses heavily on classroom management techniques and lesson planning. Regular classroom observations and feedback from the school leadership team provide teachers with a view to their strengths and how they can continuously develop.    Our students are our primary but not the sole beneficiaries. Our school is non-selective, which means we do not restrict ourselves or select the students that we admit to the school. We admit all those in need of a good quality education.  The parents and families of these children are our second level beneficiaries. They are set to benefit in the future because their children can access a quality education at present, which will prepare them for life, allowing them to have a career of their choice and as a result help their families out of the circle of poverty. Our families come from communities located between 2 - 4.5 km from our schools. Our children's average family income is between Rs. 5,000 - 6,000 per month, though many survive on less than this. Most of our children are Hindi speaking, although we also have some with Tamil, Nepali, Bengali and Punjabi as their mother tongue.    Yes, our schools have received recognition from several of our visitors. Just recently, Anil Swarup, Secretary, MHRD, who visited our school spoke to us about developing a prototype to be able to replicate our model.  PPPs need to be considered in India as a model for equalising educational opportunity to the economically and socially deprived segments of society. The current momentum around PPP in school education is a very positive development.  A larger discussion and introduction of various players into the PPP discourse is now required to explore how the government can create a sustainable ecosystem for players like Peepul to scale their work, what the necessary features of a stable and effective regulatory system are and the need for a dependable monitoring mechanism based on transparency and mutual trust is critical.    When we began our schools, the learning levels of the children were very low. The children we serve have not had access to toys, learning materials or books, all crucial for cognitive development. Most being first-generation learners, had never been read to and their vocabulary levels were much lower in comparison to children from affluent backgrounds. Few had any understanding of expected classroom behaviour.  Now, we have developed strong school routines. Students know how to listen to instructions, pay attention, participate, work with their peers, and are truly getting the most out of the school day. The emphasis on good hygiene, regular health check-ups and the provision of an additional meal at our flagship school have significantly improved the health of many children.  Being used to rote learning as the only method of teaching and notebooks being filled as a matter of course, many parents worried that their child was spending their time at school simply playing. However, they now understand that the activities being done in school are leading to their children learning faster than they could by rote methods.    Our students have made great progress, both academically and in terms of their behaviour. Our year-end assessments showed significant student growth, 76% of all students either met or exceeded grade-level expectations across all 3 subjects-English, Hindi and Mathematics. Strong classroom routines and behaviour trackers help us maintain a high standard of discipline among our students.  Based on our proof of concept, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) extended the programme under the name of School Quality Enhancement Programme (SQEP) in 2016. There are now 30 SDMC schools partnered with NGOs. All the partner organizations, including Peepul schools, are working in partnership to increase enrolment and the quality of education in these schools. Key performance indicators and school-specific targets for enrolment, teacher and student attendance, student retention and student academic achievement are being tracked to ensure that there is a focus on quality.    The first key challenge faced by us is f inancial sustainability. Due to lack of a sustainability model with the government, we end up investing our own resources to keep the quality of our programme high. As a result, there is a perpetual requirement of gap funding which impacts the sustainability of school operations and causes us to shift our energy to raising funds and away from managing daily operations. In the long run, until a cost-per-child reimbursement model is in place (or similar financial reimbursement), operators such as Peepul may not have an incentive to enter whole school management contracts.  The other challenge lies in ensuring there is data to assess the improvement in learning outcomes at the partnership schools. Since this is a quality intervention, it is critical to measure the student outcomes at government schools and across grades to conduct an appropriate baseline and end line. Assessments are not conducted uniformly across all government schools making it difficult to compare the actual improvement in the partnership school with any other standard of performance.    Quality education is critical to the economic success of individuals and the whole country, and it is imperative that responsible individuals and businesses support right initiatives, especially for disadvantaged children. We need to give the growing young population the skills they need to succeed in the global economy.  Few ways in which interested people can support our work are:  Featured Image Credits: srsvasisht on Visual Hunt / CC BY-NC-SA © 2015 DailyHunt ","An interview with Kruti Bharucha, CEO of Peepul Foundation ",https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/qrius-epaper-qrius/an+interview+with+kruti+bharucha+ceo+of+peepul+foundation-newsid-79464567
" Lord Shiva along with Lord Brahma and Vishnu together form the entire universe. Their powers and strength to control the world are immeasurable. We often claim to know a lot about this holy Tridev diety. But, history holds a lot of mystery for all of us in store. Today, we are going to discuss the lesser-known part of Lord Shiva's life. Just as every human being needs a family that can back them up whenever and wherever possible, Lord Shiva also had someone who was created on his wife's insistence.But, what followed after that was unexpected. I'm talking about his sister Devi Asavari. Read further and you will know some unknown facts about Asavari. Mythological evidence are a proof of the fact that Lord Shiva created his sister Asavari on his wife, Devi Parvati's insistence. After getting married to Lord Shiva, Parvati moved to his abode, but she always missed her family and sisters there. Though Lord Shiva's beloved Nandi took extra care of Parvati Ji, then too, she started feeling lonely. © 2015 DailyHunt ","Do You Know About 'Devi Asavari', The Sister Of Lord Shiva?

"  Sexual harassment, rape, sexual abusive is a part of a girl's life. From a new born baby to getting old, she has to face many troubles throughout her life. Some get into depression and some get rid out of it and starts their new life. But they have to face the scare of this pain every night.

She said, it took long years to come out of that incident and it took lot of courage to speak about the incident.  In a magazine's interview, Tabu's sister Farah Naaz accused Jackie Shroff for molesting Tabu. And this is the reason that Tabu and Jackie never worked together in any film.      Preeti wanted to be an actress in Bollywood. In the year 2004, she claimed that director Madhur Bhandarkar raped her for continuous 6 years.  She said that the director promised her that he will launch in her film and from 1999 to 2004 he raped her. In 2006, the rape case was registered by Preeti against the director.    The ex-girlfriend of Salman Khan, Somi Ali has revealed in an interview that she had experienced sexual assault. She was raped by her servant when she was just 5.

"Close on the heels of a proposal to construct a new airport at Padubidri, between Mangaluru and Udupi, questions are raised about its feasibility by the former director of Mangaluru Airport M R Vasudeva Rao.His main objection is that a new airport at Padubidri will make the existing one at Bajpe redundant. The major section of commuters at the Mangaluru airport is from Kasargod. Bajpe to Kasargod is only 65 km, whereas Padubidri is 100 KM. The Kannur airport at Kerala, for which works are already undergoing, is only 92 KM to Kasargod. Hence commuters will prefer to go to Kannur, he says.Technically the Padubidri airport will not be feasible because Mangaluru airport already has a runway of 2.45 KM. Mere extending of another 550 meters will enable even airbus to land. The land required for it is already with the Airport Authority of India. The extension of 420 meters is very much feasible. The additional land to be acquired for this purpose is merely 90 acres as against the 1000 acres required for the new airport. Regarding the doubt expressed about constructing a runway on the hillock, Vasudev Rao asks ""who said it is not possible? Has a survey been made?"" he asks.Constructing a new airport costs huge funds, to the tune of Rs 5000 crores to Rs 10,000 crores and land of 1000 acres, whereas extending the Mangaluru Bajpe airport costs only Rs 1120 crores and acquiring 90 acres of land. Shifting of infrastructure like radar etc will once again cost additional.In 1988-89 when extension of Mangaluru airport was planned, 6000 ft land at Nandikur, Padubidri for construction of runway was available. At Bengre 8000 ft for runway was also available. The reason Bajpe was chosen was that both Padubidri and Bengre were found not suitable. It took 14 years to acquire the land for Mangaluru airport. Now, how long it will take to acquire 1000 acres of land for proposed new airport is anybody guess, he said.© 2015 DailyHunt ",New airport between Mangaluru and Udupi raises questions about feasibility ,https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/asianet+newsable-epaper-asnewsab/new+airport+between+mangaluru+and+udupi+raises+questions+about+feasibility-newsid-68912706
